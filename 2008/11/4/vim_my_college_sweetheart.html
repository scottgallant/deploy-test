      <p>It&#39;s true, I did write my <a href="https://github.com/mattmatt/deception_toolkit/tree">diploma thesis</a> using Vim. Old-school with LaTeX and C++. When I came to the Mac five years ago I was still using the now pretty much dead <a href="http://www.macvim.org">Carbon version of MacVim</a>. And well, it just didn&#39;t feel right. I&#39;m very comfortable on the command line, but on the Mac I wanted something that integrated well with the rest of that system, that behave like a real Mac application.</p>

<p>Of course, like a lot of people, I found TextMate. Who could resist the cool stuff as seen on the first Rails screencasts? I sure couldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been using it a good three and a half years now, and I still like it.</p>

<p>But recently the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">Cocoa version of MacVim</a> scratched my itch. It was Jamis Buck&#39;s <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim">blog entry</a> that eventually pushed me over the edge, and had me trying out working with Vim for the last week or so. And holy crap, a lot has happened in the world of Vim since I left it for good. Omni completion, a really good Rails script package, and lots of other cool stuff.</p>

<p>So I gave it a go, and it was like Jamis said, it kinda felt like coming back home. I spent most of my university days with Vim, actually the first years using the old-school Solaris vi. So it basically felt like I never left.</p>

<p>I got pretty fluent with it pretty quickly, and started looking for a nice set of scripts that would fit my workflow. I found</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rails.vim.tpope.net/">rails.vim</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERD tree</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273">taglist</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643">SuperTab</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It all felt pretty good in the beginning, especially rails.vim is an amazing package. But after using it for a week it made me realize one thing: That I haven&#39;t dived into the Rails bundles deep enough. There&#39;s a lot of things in rails.vim that the TextMate bundle also has. What is seriously cool in Vim is the completion, but I just don&#39;t use it that much, and it can be frickin slow if you&#39;re on a big project.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s mainly my main gripe, it all didn&#39;t feel very speedy. It took one to two seconds for a normal file to load, what with all the BufRead action going on for Ruby and Rails project files. I didn&#39;t mind it that much in the beginning, but it got really annoying. Plus, a lot of the plugins, like NERD tree, or taglist felt kinda bolted on. </p>

<p>So here I am working in TextMate, still loving Vim for it&#39;s flexibility and simple effectiveness, promising myself to delve deeper into what the bundles offer. It was a great week, and I&#39;m glad that Vim gets the love it deserves.</p>

<p>One issue that drove me back to Vim was the fact that there&#39;s no news on what&#39;s happening in TextMate development, and what will be in 2.0. What the week in Vim made me realize were that TextMate could use stuff like split-screen editing, the ability to handle bigger files without hogging memory and CPU, and maybe some real good SCM integration.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe though was that file types didn&#39;t stick, switching from Rails to RSpec and Shoulda and back just seemed to confuse TextMate. I was made aware that there actually is a <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2007/file-type-detection-rspec-rails/">&quot;fix&quot;</a> for that problem, but that just isn&#39;t a full solution. It helps right now, but I can only hope that TextMate 2 integrates something like <a href="http://konstochvanligasaker.se/tabmate/">TabMate</a>, just maybe not with modlines but with metadata.</p>
