      <p>About eighteen months ago <a href="/2008/11/4/vim_my_college_sweetheart.html">I wrote about going back to Vim as my daily text
editor</a>. It was a bust, and I went back to TextMate after about a week.</p>

<p>Suddenly it&#39;s the year 2010, and I&#39;m typing this in <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>. What happened? My itch was re-scratched
if you will. I was wary of some of TextMate&#39;s perceived shortcomings, and honestly I missed having a command and insert
mode. It may sound stupid, but I really prefer that way of working with text and code. TextMate is still a nice
editor, but seeing its development coming to a perceived halt made me realize that Vim is simply forever, not being
developed by just one guy, but a community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that I simply started from scratch. Last time I built upon a configuration that grew over the
years, and that included things about whose purpose I just had no idea. I watched the <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i">Smash Into Vim
PeepCode</a> too, and started with the clean slate configuration set that
comes with it. If you&#39;re thinking of getting (back) into Vim, it&#39;s highly recommended, it&#39;s sure to wet your appetite.
There&#39;s also a <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">collection of screencasts</a> and a <a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim">free book on Vim
7</a> available on the interwebs. I have some useful links in <a href="http://delicious.com/pombsd/vim">my bookmark collection
too</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot of developments around scripts for Vim that bring TextMate-like functionality, or that support things
like Cucumber, smart quotes and <a href="http://townk.github.com/vim-autoclose/">auto-closing braces</a>, or even the most awesome
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975">Git integration</a> you&#39;ll find. But the nicest of them all is
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332">Pathogen</a>, a script that allows you to keep all your other
scripts in separate places, not losing overview of what&#39;s installed where, and in which version.</p>

<p>Coming from TextMate, you&#39;re gonna miss the &quot;Go To File&quot; dialog, I&#39;m sure. Check out
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">Command-T</a>, which does exactly that, only with path-matching
sprinkled on top. It&#39;s not as fast unfortunately, but a lot faster to use than the annoying fuzzy thing I used the last
time I tried to live on Vim. There&#39;s also <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen">PeepOpen</a>, but it always opens files
in new tabs, and that can get quite annoying, as new Vim tabs are quite different from Vim buffers. For project views I
use <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERDtree</a>, though
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1890">LustyExplorer</a> also seems acceptable.</p>

<p>As I said, I started from scratch, with a clean slate. So the decent thing to do was to put all my <a href="http://github.com/mattmatt/dotvim">Vim configuration
files on GitHub</a>. They include all the scripts I&#39;m using, and my configuration, all
neatly separated into different bundles thanks to Pathogen. There&#39;s a couple of things that are still a bit wonky.
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050">Lusty Juggler</a> doesn&#39;t work as advertised all the time, though
it&#39;s a neat tool, allowing you to quickly select one of a list of the latest open buffers. RubyTest is quite weird, and
I&#39;m thinking of dumping it completely, and simply rolling my own commands to run tests based on it. The
<a href="http://rails.vim.tpope.net/">rails.vim</a> script package does include some support to run tests too, but not to execute a
single test case.</p>

<p>In general, I haven&#39;t found anything that works in TextMate that you can&#39;t somehow get to work in Vim. Yes, I&#39;ve used
the word somehow. It&#39;s not easy as pie all of the time, and it can be different, heck it&#39;s a different editor. But I
willingly accept that, because as a text editor, I find Vim to be a lot better than TextMate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been back on Vim for a month now, and I&#39;m not looking back at all. It&#39;s like coming back to an old friend and
learning what awesome things he&#39;s been up to. It&#39;s pretty much as exciting as playing with new technologies at the
moment. Learning new things can be pretty exciting, even if it&#39;s just another text editor. But it&#39;s not all fun and
giggles. I have some annoyances still, but no editor is perfect. I&#39;m more willing to accept Vim&#39;s for the increased text
surgeon skills than TextMate&#39;s, to be frank. TextMate is still a nice editor, don&#39;t get me wrong, my heart just always
belonged to Vim.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m more willing to invest my learning time in an editor that I know I can use everywhere than one I can only
use on the Mac with a running user interface. I&#39;m using Vim on every server I&#39;m managing, so why not on my local
machine? Vim makes me think about how I can edit text in the most efficient way possible, and I like that very much. It
even made me map my caps-lock key to control, finally!</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Was just <a href="http://twitter.com/mutle/status/17356649155">tipped off</a> that PeepOpen can be made to behave
properly and open files in the current MacVim tab.  When you set your MacVim options like in the picture below (notice
the part &quot;Open files from applications&quot;), it works a treat. Thanks, Mutwin!</p>
