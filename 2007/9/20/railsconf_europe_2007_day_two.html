      <p>First up: RailsConf Europe 2008 will be in Berlin again. Woot!</p>

<p>As I wrote yesterday, Marcel Molina and Michael Michael Koziarski did a little Best Practices session for a starters. Other than that, day two was only okay.</p>

<p>Ola Bini repeated in his JRuby talk pretty much what Charles Nutter and Tom Enebo said on the first day, plus some shameless ThoughtWorks pluck.</p>

<p>I did enjoy the talk on Selenium by Till Vollmer. It&#39;s been on my list for a while, and it does look quite interesting. The questions that pop up in my head as a friend of continuous integration is of course how to automate this. But I&#39;ll just have to read up on that.</p>

<p>Ben Nolan (creator of Behaviour.js) showed some neat tricks using functional programming with JavaScript. He brought up some ideas and showed code, which I very much appreciated. Nothing new for the JavaScript cracks really, but still interesting.</p>

<p>Jay Fields talked about the presenter pattern in Rails. I bet a lot of people thought after the talk: wtf? To sum up his findings on the presenter pattern in Rails were rather negative and probably not what a lot of people expected. I found his talk to be a change to the others. It&#39;s not always the success stories that make you push hard, but also down-falls, even if they&#39;re small ones. He put up all the details in his <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/09/railsconf-europe-07-presenter-links.html">blog</a>. Definitely worth checking out.</p>

<p>In all I would&#39;ve wished for more detail in the presentations. A lot of the presenters spent too much time introducing things, presenting theory, and so on. More code please, people! When people come to the RailsConf I take it for granted they know Rails enough to get down and dirty immediately.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/11-sun-surprises-at-railsconf-europe-2007">DHH</a> wrote on his blog I too was quite impressed by the engagement of Sun in Ruby and Rails. Craig McCanahan (of Struts fame) talked about it and said he can&#39;t imagine going back to Java for web development after having worked with Rails. Amen to that.</p>

<p>I got some nice ideas and things to look into out of it, but I have hoped for more. But still I&#39;m looking forward to next year.</p>
