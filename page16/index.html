        <p>This is the essay version of a talk I gave at <a href="http://jimdo.com">Jimdo</a>.</p>

<h3>Out of Business</h3>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> started out as a small platform for Ruby
projects to run their tests on. Back in 2010 and 2011, there was a distinct lack
of hosted continuous integration platforms.</p>

<p>It was launched close to the day, three years ago, with a small announcement.</p>

<p>Some Ruby projects quickly adopted it, Rails started officially moving their
tests to Travis CI.</p>

<p>Later, in 2011, more language communities discovered the platform. We added
official support for PHP, for languages running on the JVM, for Erlang and for
Python.</p>

<p>We now also support Perl, Haskell, and anything you&#39;d possibly want to run on a
Linux platform. Plus, you can build projects on OS X and for iOS.</p>

<h3>Unfinished Business</h3>

<p><img src="http://s3itch.paperplanes.de/travis_team.jpg_20140115_182717.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Initially, Travis CI only supported open source projects. But people and
companies kept asking us to use our platform for their private projects as well.</p>

<p>The idea was floated to found a company and turn this into a business, work on
Travis CI full time and get paid to do it.</p>

<p>By the end of 2011, a company was founded, and two more people joined the team.
We were five people trying to build a business, four of them developers.</p>

<p>In early 2012, we started a crowd-funding campaign to bootstrap our business and
allow some folks on the team to be paid for by the company. It allowed us to
keep the open source platform running and to improve our feature set.</p>

<p>One of the features coming out of that was pull request testing, which initially
was done by having a bot comment on pull requests, annoying the heck out of some
people.</p>

<h3>We Mean Business</h3>

<p>We started working on <a href="https://travis-ci.com">our product</a>, and we tried to
figure out the hardest part about a product, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/plans">the
pricing</a>.</p>

<p>We started thinking about revenue, all the crazy things you have to do when
building and running a business.</p>

<p>We launched our product into private beta in July 2012 and started charging in
September 2012.</p>

<p>It was all rather hack-ish, and we didn&#39;t yet force everyone to sign up for a
paid subscription. All the work involved in getting people to sign up was
manual. We picked out a few customers and emailed them, encouraging them to sign
up and to give us feedback.</p>

<h3>Back in Business</h3>

<p>This worked surprisingly well and by the end of 2012, we had more than 100
paying customers, allowing us to pay two on our team some sort of wage. Plus, we
could pay for our infrastructure.</p>

<p>While that didn&#39;t imply a raging success, the signs looked right.</p>

<p>Whilst trying to build up our business, we had to solve scaling puzzles already
on our open source platform. This was both blessing and curse.</p>

<p>We were running 7000 builds per day in 2012, compared to 700 in 2011.</p>

<p>In comparison, by the end of 2013, we were running a total of 65000 builds per
day.</p>

<p>Solving these issues upfront on the open source would mean we&#39;d know how to
solve them when they&#39;d come up on our commercial platform. On the downside, we&#39;d
been distracted by these things, rather than being able to focus on the
business.</p>

<p>We were able to break Travis CI early on and see the potential affects of any
fixes before they&#39;d become critical to our business.</p>

<p>As a challenge to ourselves, there&#39;s one special ticket that was opened in early 2013.
When our business was in a stable state, we&#39;ll be shaving off Sven&#39;s mustache.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3itch.paperplanes.de/mustache.jpg_20140115_182418.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h3>Business Never Personal</h3>

<p>For developers, though, business is tough. Figuring out how much to charge, how
to approach customers, how to do customer support (and to understand how
important it is), is something entirely new for most.</p>

<p>It posed a big challenge for us, and it took a while to get everyone behind the
idea that customer support is essential to our business. When it comes to code,
every customers&#39; project is a unique snowflake.</p>

<p>Every project has its own interesting dependencies that can break in the most
curious ways. Complex test suites pose challenges for our platform and for our
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Solving these can be a tough challenge, but talking to customers about them
upfront is what makes them less painful to them.</p>

<p>We spent some time thinking about how we can make Travis CI, how we can surprise
our customers. A friend floated the idea of using coffee as an inspiration.</p>

<p>Initially, we wanted to send thank you notes. But we wanted to add an extra
twist. A friend suggested we could send out bags of coffees to our customers,
combining our passions, and doing something completely unexpected for our
customers.</p>

<p>So far, we only shipped some 300 bags, as we had to take a break to tackle some
issues, but we intend to pick this idea up again.</p>

<h3>Strictly Business</h3>

<p>Rather than do strictly business, we wanted to run an open company.</p>

<p>When we have problems that affect our customers and users, we try to be as open
as possible about them. They&#39;re annoying, but when explained, people do
understand that scaling issues can pose unforeseen challenges that aren&#39;t easy
to solve.</p>

<p>Open operations an unintended marketing channel, if you will. Based on the
openness, people can decide whether they want to buy into the fact that we do
have outages, that we do have issues, or not.</p>

<p>Marketing is an interesting topic, as we technically didn&#39;t do any. None that is
directly measurable or where customer growth can be attributed to. Whether
that&#39;s a good thing or not, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The one business-changing thing we did in 2013 was to finally put up a landing
page for our product and to actively let people try out our platform and allow
them to pay for it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our secret to strictly business.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t give people the opportunity to try out and pay for your product,
how and why would they?</p>

<h3>Business as Usual</h3>

<p>When we finally solved our bigger technical challenges to scale out the
platform, we were faced with new challenges: people.</p>

<p>Something every company experiences at some point in its lifetime is to hire
people.</p>

<p>We started hiring a <a href="https://travis-ci.com/team">few more people</a> in 2013,
people working remotely from the start.</p>

<p>We wanted them to feel like they&#39;re a part of the team, like their happiness is
what&#39;s most important to us.</p>

<p>This is a tough challenge, and we have yet to figure it out. I&#39;d say we&#39;re doing
pretty okay, but there&#39;s always room for improvement.</p>

<p>One thing we&#39;re trying out currently is support rotation, with everyone on the
team involved, no matter their status. The more everyone on the team knows about
the product, the more eyes we have on ideas to improve it. The more everyone is
exposed to customer issues, the higher the incentive to fix them.</p>

<p>We give people on our team the freedom to do whatever they like, whenever they
like. A happy team with a focus on customer value leads to happy customers and a
healthy business.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our ideal.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2014, we have 700 paying customers. That may not sound like
a lot, but it&#39;s close to infinity when you&#39;re starting a business from scratch.</p>

<p>We&#39;re running a bootstrapped business, we&#39;ve turned down VC funding multiple
times, and proudly so.</p>

<p>Open source is still at the core of our business and our team.</p>

<p>We believe in the power of building good products with people who are passionate
about them.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="item_content">
        <p>I got to read a lot of great books in 2013, shaping a lot of my current thinking
both in terms of business and web operations. If you&#39;re looking for something to
read, follow along!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k04aEv">Effective Monitoring and Alerting</a></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve developed an interest in improving our monitoring, and this book delivered
some good insight. The book is a quick read, and it ends up delivering a great
idea for how a monitoring system could be structured, without going too much
into implementation details.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a distinct lack of books on this topic, so this one is good to start
with.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/VIzk5F">The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — but Some Don&#39;t</a></strong></p>

<p>From the guy who predicted the 2012 election results, a great introduction on
statistics, probability, written in an entertaining style (i.e. not boring you
with too much math). Gives lots of examples from Nate&#39;s personal history of
getting into numbers and probabilities. Very entertaining read and will
definitely make you think about these topics some more.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/19CvJvW">The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable</a></strong></p>

<p>Nassim Taleb has an interesting writing style, to say the least. Among slews of
bashing other people and polishing his own ego, you&#39;ll find streaks of genius.</p>

<p>The Black Swan is a great read on managing risk, or the inability of managing
certain risks. If you&#39;re running any kind of application in production and are
actively involved in operations, this book is a must-read.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s point could be made in a significantly shorter version of it, but
that would of course deprive you from the joys of reading about Taleb&#39;s personal
feelings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1ggeyTC">The Art of Capacity Planning</a></strong></p>

<p>This book is a classic, and I only got around to reading it this year, shame on
me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s wonderfully short and to the point, dealing a lot with monitoring and
making your capacity planning work in the best ways possible.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read this book yet, start right now. It&#39;s timeless for anyone
working in web operations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/17MZDcz">Friendly Fire: The Accidental Shootdown of U.S. Black Hawks over Northern
Iraq</a></strong></p>

<p>A book describing in great detail the shootdown of two helicopters over the
no-fly zone in Iraq in the early nineties.</p>

<p>Why is this relevant and interesting? It&#39;s pretty terrible that people have died
during this incident.</p>

<p>The fascinating parts of this incident and the book are in what happened in all
the parties involved in the incidents and in the organizations as a whole, for
years leading up to the event.</p>

<p>This book was an eye-opener for me on how I think about production incidents. It
covers in great, great detail the events in a socio-technological organization, the
US military.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much to learn in this book that can be applied to web operations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/124nNwD">The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error</a></strong></p>

<p>Sidney Dekker is a great writer on topics are very relevant to web operations:
humans.</p>

<p>Human error is a common excuse for production incidents, all the more so when a
plane crashed or other bad things happen.</p>

<p>Dekker puts these things in perspective, and he&#39;s helped shape my thinking a
lot. What a human does in a particular situation, why he does it and how the
organization and the work environment have shaped his understanding of a
particular situation.</p>

<p>A great and highly recommended read, goes nicely with Snook&#39;s &quot;Friendly Fire.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1dkq4wR">Managing the Unexpected: Resilient Performance in an Age of Uncertainty</a></strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this book, I bought it on a hunch.</p>

<p>It turns out it&#39;s an important read when it comes to managing risk and achieving
organizational resilience. Fits in perfectly with the books mentioned just
before.</p>

<p>It looks at a slew of different industries and on how they handle risk and risky
situations. Fire departments, air travel, and lots more.</p>

<p>It introduces the concept of a high resilience organization and a lot of great
ideas, which are picked up by Dekker in a book introduced below.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k09Iic">Thinking in Systems</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The</strong> book on complex systems and systems theory.</p>

<p>I was amazed, only in hindsight, how important this book is. It introduces the
idea of complex systems and how parts in a complex system interact with each
other, how they influence each other, how even just small changes in one can
have long and delayed effects on others.</p>

<p>The book introduces these concepts in ways not directly related to web
operations and software, but you&#39;ll notice the relationships right away.</p>

<p>This is <strong>the</strong> book to read. Read this one first, read it now. The most
influential book I&#39;ve read in 2013.</p>

<p>After reading &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot;, you&#39;ll see systems and complex interactions
between systems everywhere. You know why? Because there are systems everywhere.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1d3lKOX">Small Giants: Companies That Chose to Be Great Instead of
Big</a></strong></p>

<p>Running a <a href="https://travis-ci.com">small little business myself</a>, I strive to get
as much inspiration and insight on how others running their companies as
possible.</p>

<p>This book has been a big inspiration for me. It covers a dozen or so companies
that did everything they could to build a balanced workplace with happy
employees and a long-lasting legacy rather than go for the big buck or for
outside funding.</p>

<p>Lots of great stories in this book. If you&#39;re running any kind of business, this
is a great read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1fEZykf">The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at
NASA </a></strong></p>

<p>This book is so chock full of insight on behaviors and interactions in
socio-technical organization, it kept blewing my mind over and over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the Challenger incident in 1986, and everything contributing to this
incident over years leading up to it.</p>

<p>The level of detail extracted by Diane Vaughan is amazing. She introduces the
term &quot;normalization of deviance&quot; in the book, a term that stuck with me, and
that I&#39;m now seeing everywhere. It provides a description for something that
naturally happens, whether we want it or not, but that seems unavoidable.</p>

<p>Again, this book isn&#39;t directly related to software, but it&#39;s so very relevant
to what we do in web operations. Humans, human interaction, organizations and
culture. I found these bits to be the most interesting and fascinating bits when
it comes to running anything in production.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious about these bits too, then this book is for you. Together with
&quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, it provides amazing insights and learnings for running your own
operations team or how to improve human interaction and culture at your company
overall.</p>

<p>These books are very relevant to the ideas of DevOps.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k0cLaf">Drift Into Failure</a></strong></p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve read &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot;, &quot;Managing the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Friendly
Fire&quot;, and &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot;, here comes Dekker putting all of
them together, quite literally.</p>

<p>I was quite amazed to find references to all of them in this book.</p>

<p>The books left me wondering a bit on how you can detect normalization of
deviance, what you can learn from the Challenger and Iraq incidents, from
high-resilience organizations.</p>

<p>This book is Dekker helping you find answers.</p>

<p>Read &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot; first, then &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, &quot;Managing the
Unexpected&quot; and &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot;, and then read &quot;Drift Into
Failure&quot; to find more practical applications of what&#39;s been introduced in the
other books.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my mind blown several times by all of them. They&#39;re pretty amazing
eye-openers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1dktFuE">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></strong></p>

<p>Just started reading this, but it seems relevant to the topics of biases. Had it
on my reading list for a while now, so it&#39;s about time to read it.</p>

<p>Will have to report back on this soon.</p>
