        <h4><a href="/2014/6/25/the-power-of-saying-no.html" title="The Power of Saying No (To Sugar)">25 June 2014</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/roidrage">Mathias Meyer</a></h4>

        <p>Over the last couple of weeks, I&#39;ve been avoiding sugar. Not just avoiding
eating spoon-fulls of crystal sugar, but avoiding food and drink that contains
sugar.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thinking about reducing my sugar intake for a while now. There&#39;s <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/opinion/what-causes-weight-gain.html">been
enough change in how science sees the sources of weight
gain</a>
to be convincing.</p>

<p>But regardless, I found myself eating pie on the weekend, grab a sweet snack
regularly (the perils of working from home) or regularly get a cookie or cheese
cake at the coffee shop. It just seems like the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;d always be the convincing argument to myself that I could stop
anytime I want, the classic trap of letting your irrational self get in the way
of rational decisions. Just ask any smoker.</p>

<p>But then I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@cammipham/7-things-you-need-to-stop-doing-to-be-more-productive-backed-by-science-a988c17383a6">an article that pointed to actively saying no being a
possible
answer</a>.
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/663212?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103851959041">Studies
showed</a>
that people who said &quot;I don&#39;t&quot; were much more likely to resist something than
people who said &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>Pretty remarkable, and I wanted to turn that into an experiment with myself.</p>

<p>It made me think of the day when I stopped smoking, on March 30, 1999.</p>

<p>All I said to myself was &quot;I&#39;m not smoking anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>I chucked my remaining cigarettes without much further thought, and that was the
end of it.</p>

<p>The hardest part of breaking out of a habit is finding a replacement. Rather
than resort to a cigarette after lunch or other meals, I went for a coffee
instead.</p>

<p>Yes, this is how my coffee affinity started.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something powerful in consciously saying no. One day, I decided to just
say no to sugar.</p>

<p>That meant cutting out delicious things like cookies, cake, pie and everything
else that contains processed sugar, but it&#39;s for the good of the bigger picture.
Most of these are non-essential foods.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no rational downside to saying no to sugar.</p>

<p>But the real power is in consciously saying no to something. Whether it&#39;s a
habit you want to get rid of, or whether it&#39;s a feature you want to add to
your product or simple deciding on what you want to do with your day, your
month, your life.</p>

<p>Saying no to something can have an incredible effect on your conscious to
actually go through with it.</p>

<p><strong>Knowing what not to do can be quite liberating for your mind too. It leaves
room for other, more important things to do.</strong></p>

        <p>Thanks to the internet and the wild things our mobile devices can now do, we can
connect with people anywhere, heck, even on the toilet, what used to be a
sanctuary of quiet contemplation.</p>

<p>We love the distractions and the small kicks we&#39;re getting when something new
happens, when someone likes our photo, when someone favorites a tweet or
mentions us on Twitter.</p>

<p>We&#39;re prone to these distractions, to being busy, to just waiting for another
email to come in. I am myself. It&#39;s been incredibly hard getting out of the
habit of having my life evolve around the computer all day long. In particular,
because our entire business is not only running thanks to and on the internet,
it&#39;s also because we&#39;re a distributed team.</p>

<p>Because we&#39;re split out across time zones, you&#39;ll find someone in our chat room
most of the time. If it&#39;s not one from our team, there&#39;s probably a customer I
can help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tempting to leave the chat open while you&#39;re busy with other things. It&#39;s
tempting to take a peek regularly to make sure you&#39;re not missing out on
anything. It&#39;s tempting to take the laptop with you to the playground to check
your email and do some work while your kid is playing (yes, I&#39;ve done that too).</p>

<p>But what does it give you really beyond the simple satisfaction of yet another
distraction?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t put an instant price, value or reward on just watching your child
play. It doesn&#39;t reward us in the same way as someone liking our post on
Facebook.</p>

<p>Yet it&#39;s all we strive for, the distractions, getting more work done, staying up
late to fix just one more bug.</p>

<p>Is that what we want to look back at when as we&#39;re getting older? Are we going
to measure us based on the number of retweets we&#39;ve received in our lifetime?</p>

<p>Or is there something more to life that we&#39;ve somehow forgotten, something
that&#39;s as simple as stepping away from your computer and devices and just
enjoying life?</p>

        <h4><a href="/2014/6/23/planning-your-week.html" title="Planning Your Week">23 June 2014</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/roidrage">Mathias Meyer</a></h4>

        <p>Our household recently picked up an interesting habit, one where people tell me
they couldn&#39;t do it, or they just don&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>Every weekend, we sit down and plan our dinner meals for the entire week.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it, that&#39;s the whole habit. Seems straight-forward, doesn&#39;t it? It&#39;s so
incredibly dull, even very German.</p>

<p>Five weekdays, two weekend days. Sit down, thumb through cookbooks, find some
recipes to cook, make a shopping list, and off you go.</p>

<p>As a family, we mostly cook meals for dinner rather than for lunch, and I found
that one of us usually goes shop for groceries every day, trying to figure out
what to make for dinner, spending some extra money for things we probably don&#39;t
need along the way.</p>

<p>It feels a bit chaotic, but more than that, it causes stress and tends to make
us spend more money every day when we go shopping. Little snack, little drink
there, it adds up.</p>

<p>So we commit to the week upfront. It takes a bit of work to sit down and find
nice recipes to cook, but that time is paid off by only having to go shopping
once a week, twice if we do weekends and weekdays separately.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an amazing little habit change, and it does require a commitment to what
you&#39;ve planned to cook, but it reduces the stress levels throughout the entire
following week.</p>

<p>Yet it seems so hard to commit to something like this, why is that?</p>

<p>Maybe we feel uncomfortable planning that far ahead, maybe the effort of even
finding something to cook is throwing us off?</p>

<p>If you have a family and kids to feed, I&#39;d suggest you try this out. Not just
shopping for food once a week, but planning dinner meals for every single day in
advance.</p>

<p>It gives an amazing peace of mind in return for a little focused time
investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/6/13/implement-routines-to-foster-habits.html">Beyond daily
routines</a>,
even having specific routines can be very beneficial for your overall
productivity. You could start by trying to plan your dinner meals for the entire
week.</p>
