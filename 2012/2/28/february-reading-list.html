      <p>With February almost over, it&#39;s time to give you news things to read, or at
least to make a list of things I&#39;ve been reading lately.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/yB6NUE"><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong></a></p>

<p>A rather wordy and very repetitive excursion into the ideas behind continuous
delivery, which involves continuous integration, continuous deployment and lots
of other things. While I&#39;m all on board with the ideas in the book, it&#39;s simply
too long. Every chapter repeats a lot of the things from other chapters, mostly
with the purpose of being easily accessible on their own. I like the book in
general, but 500 pages for a book like this is simply too long.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html"><strong>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</strong></a></p>

<p>This is an incredible resource, and best of all, it&#39;s free. Several open source
projects are outlined from how their architecture evolved over time and how they
came about to begin with.</p>

<p>The chapters I&#39;ve very much enjoyed so far are
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/graphite.html">Graphite</a>,
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/hdfs.html">HDFS</a>, <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/riak.html">Erlang and
Riak</a>,
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/sendmail.html">Sendmail</a>. But the best chapter by
far is the one on BerkeleyDB, the key-value store you didn&#39;t know you&#39;d find
everywhere. It&#39;s an exceptional read and should be mandatory for software
developers. It&#39;s a great story on how to evolve architecture of what started out
as a simple library over the course of 20 years.</p>

<p>While the book is free to read online, please consider buying if you like it.
It&#39;s for a good cause too. There&#39;s a second volume in the works, due in March.</p>

<p><a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do"><strong>Things Caches Do</strong></a></p>

<p>A short and simple read on what web caches do. If you build web apps, read this.
Also has links to more in-depth articles on HTTP and caching.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-4.html"><strong>Probabilistically Bounded Staleness for Practical Partial Quorums</strong></a></p>

<p>An analysis of how eventual and consistent eventual consistency is. Relevant if
you&#39;re dealing with Dynamo-style databases, but an interesting read any way you
look at it. Accompanied by a
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Epbailis/projects/pbs/">website</a> that allows you
to calculate the probability that data in a quorum-replicated cluster is
consistent over time.</p>

<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/design.html"><strong>Design of Apache Kafka, a high-throughput distributed messaging system</strong></a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re into messaging, you should read this, especially if all you know is
RabbitMQ and Redis for queueing. Both don&#39;t scale well and they&#39;re not easy to
make fault-tolerant. Kafka, built at LinkedIn, follows a very different design
to allow being run fully distributed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ArchitectNotes"><strong>Notes on Varnish, from the Architect</strong></a></p>

<p>The ideas behind Varnish, why Squid&#39;s way is outdated, and a perspective on
great uses of memory-mapped files. Short and self-congratulatory read.</p>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html"><strong>The LMAX Architecture</strong></a></p>

<p>After reading this, you&#39;ll have a different perspective on things when it comes
to building high-throughput systems. LMAX is a real-time trading site, and this
article describes how they built the service that manages millions of trades per
second. Other than your typical architecture description on
<a href="http://highscalability.com/">highscalability.com</a>, this is one has a lot of
great information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix10/tech/full_papers/Hunt.pdf"><strong>ZooKeeper</strong></a></p>

<p>A paper on <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a>, a system for coordinating process in distributed systems.
This is a surprisingly good read, and it also outlines several use cases for
ZooKeeper.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/AAApeq"><strong>The Lean Startup</strong></a></p>

<p>People raved about this book, and it was recommended to me from several folks.
After reading it, I&#39;m rather meh on it. It felt like reading an over-glorified
handbook for a process that startups <em>must</em> adopt to be successful. Overuse of
the words &quot;disruptive&quot;, &quot;pivot&quot;, &quot;startup&quot;, and &quot;entrepreneur&quot; all but added to
the slightly weird taste the book left me with.</p>

<p>Still, I don&#39;t think of reading something as a waste. If anything, this book
helped me clarify my thoughts on the matter and gave me more perspective. That&#39;s
what reading to me is all about.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/wlJQUw"><strong>Why We Get Fat</strong></a></p>

<p>I got curiously interested in how the body works and, in particular, how
carbohydrates affect it. While this book should be taken with a spoon full of
salt, I learned quite a bit from it.</p>

<p><strong>Read, Read!</strong></p>

<p>If you want to read something really good like right now. Make it the
aforementioned chapter on BerkeleyDB and the ZooKeeper paper.</p>
