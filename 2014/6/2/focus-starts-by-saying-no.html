      <p>Every product out there is riddled by a thousand customers&#39; requests for a
thousand features. Every single one of them has an idea on what would make your
product better, what would make it more suitable for their purpose, for their
daily work.</p>

<p>As a business, even as an open source project, it&#39;s too easy to get swamped by
feature requests. But even worse, it&#39;s too easy to fall into the trap of feeling
the need to implement all of them, or at least as many as humanly possible.</p>

<p>After all, the customer is always right, aren&#39;t they?</p>

<p>When you want to tackle a thousand little feature requests, it&#39;s very easy to
lose focus. Even worse, with a small team, they&#39;ll all be busy fixing and
improving small and big things, but may be missing working towards a bigger
picture, a broader mission.</p>

<p>Look at the Leatherman, it&#39;s a testimony to tools with multiple functioning,
doing a somewhat reasonable job at every one of them. Ops people and roadies
swear by it for their every day work in data centers and on stage.</p>

<p>The Leatherman is a prime example of lots of features molded into a single tool
that&#39;s useful to a broad audience. It&#39;s even sold at a premium for the purpose.</p>

<p>Now look at an Opinel knife. It&#39;s the mark of a simple knife. It has one blade,
and depending on which one you buy, it even rusts when you don&#39;t take care of
it.</p>

<p>One blade, nothing more. But that single blade is incredibly sharp, and it stays
sharp, is easy to maintain. It&#39;s a tool with a focus, to give you the best knife
you&#39;ll have at hand, something the Leatherman won&#39;t be able to achieve.</p>

<p>It has a very narrow focus, but it excels.</p>

<p>Your product probably isn&#39;t as narrow in scope, but you should ask yourself,
what&#39;s it closer to, a Leatherman with lots of options or an Opinel, solving one
problem in the best and simplest way possible?</p>

<p>Getting there unfortunately involves saying no to a lot of those feature
requests you&#39;re getting. Figuring out what you don&#39;t want to do is just as
important as thinking about what you want to do.</p>

<p>It gives you focus, it helps to stop thinking about the features you&#39;re not
going to build. It helps you to instead focus on what you want to build.</p>

<p>A product is defined by what it can do just as much as it is by what it doesn&#39;t
do. If a feature turns out to be important enough, it&#39;ll bubble back up later.
  Saying no now doesn&#39;t close doors forever.</p>
