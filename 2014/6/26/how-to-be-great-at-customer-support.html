<p>When we set out to build <a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a> into a product and a
business, I had one thing on my agenda that I wanted us to be good at, and
that&#39;s customer support.</p>

<p>Offering an infrastructure product, we knew upfront that customers are going to
have problems setting up their projects, and we knew that there&#39;d be the
occasional hard problem to solve.</p>

<p>Customer support turned into our number one priority to get right, and here&#39;s
how we approached it.</p>

<p>Below are the simple hacks we&#39;ve learned and applied over the last two years to
make sure customers have a good experience when they interact with us. You can
apply any and all of these steps instantly to improve your own customer support.</p>

<h3>Remember Your Last Bad Support Experience</h3>

<p>The simplest thing to help you how to do great customer support is your last bad
experience with another company.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all had them, responses with blunt links to knowledge bases, canned
responses seemingly matching keywords, and a customer support representative
who&#39;s driven more by the number of calls he&#39;s making per hour than by the amount
of happiness he&#39;s brought a company&#39;s customers.</p>

<p>If I&#39;d ask you to sit down and jot down your last five bad experiences with a
product and their customer support, the last tweets you fired off into the ether
about a bad experience, you&#39;ll have a useful list in no time.</p>

<p>All you need to do now is figure out what annoyed you about these responses and
incidents and figure out how you&#39;d do it differently, how you would&#39;ve wanted to
be treated.</p>

<p><strong>Great customer support people go out of their way to help a customer, they&#39;re
the frontline of delivering happiness directly to people</strong> beyond simply selling
them a good product.</p>

<h3>First, Admit You&#39;re the Problem</h3>

<p>When a customer is frustrated, you can read it in their emails asking for help.
Some customers prefer to be snarky, others can say things that aren&#39;t very nice.
People will say negative things about your product. We may not like it, and we
may get easily offended when they do, but that shouldn&#39;t impact a positive
response.</p>

<p>When your customer is having troubles, you need to think about their pain. When
they&#39;re frustrated, it&#39;s because of your product and your decisions. Always
assume that the problem is on your end when a customer is having troubles.</p>

<p>Adopting this approach makes you think twice about your response. It removes a
barrier, it frees you from responding with a snarky email or tweet and helps you
focus on the problem.</p>

<h3>Empathy, Empathy, Empathy</h3>

<p>The most important value of interacting with customers, heck, with people, is
empathy. Understand that your product is getting in their way rather than solve
a problem, and really think about the issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to take a step back, look at all the details you have available and
consider the view of the customer.</p>

<p>Empathy means taking the time to understand other people&#39;s emotions, their train
of thought.</p>

<p><strong>Empathy is the core value of customer support</strong>. It&#39;s the one thing that makes
you great at customer support.</p>

<p>Just coincidentally, empathy also makes you a great customer to work with.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all humans, we&#39;re all driven by our own goals, and customer support is
your one means to align them.</p>

<h3>And Honesty Too</h3>

<p>If your product can&#39;t do something your customer wants, or you can&#39;t give them a
solution right now, be honest about it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, as long as you&#39;re willing to
take more time to investigate a possible solution.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t find one, it&#39;s okay to admit that. We&#39;re all humans, and not every
problem can be solved. Not every problem should be solved, at least not by your
product.</p>

<h3>Offer Solutions rather than Excuses</h3>

<p>Customers aren&#39;t interested in hearing excuses, they&#39;re interested in one thing
and one thing only, a solution to their problem.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t offer one, that&#39;s okay, but a great customer support person goes
out of their way to find one, even if it means using another product.</p>

<p><strong>Giving a customer a solution, even if it doesn&#39;t involve your product, will
make them happier than giving them none, than giving them excuses.</strong></p>

<h3>Learn How to Talk to People</h3>

<p>You won&#39;t turn into a great customer support person overnight, but you can give
your brain gentle nudges on how to talk to people better.</p>

<p>For me, reading a few books has helped a lot in shaping my languages. Two in
particular have been invaluable, and I&#39;d recommend them to anyone. They&#39;re
useful not just for customer support interactions, but for all kinds of people
interactions.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1yQHtYp">&quot;How To Win Friends and Influence People&quot;</a> is a
timeless classic, and it taught me a lot about empathy and how to approach
people in general and disgruntled customers in particular. It&#39;s the one book you
should read no matter what you do. It shaped my interactions a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1lRM3zP">&quot;Drop the Pink Elephant&quot;</a> is the perfect companion. It
teaches you about saying what you really mean rather than focus on things that
remove clarity from a conversation. It&#39;s shaped customer interactions and the
way we <a href="http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-06-26-three-ingredients-to-a-great-postmortem/">write our public
postmortems</a>.</p>

<p>Customer support is your number one differentiator as a company. It takes a lot
of work and effort, but it&#39;s your best way to make your customers happy, to have
meaningful interactions with them.</p>

<p>It pays in the long term to make sure you&#39;re doing it right. Great customer
support experiences can&#39;t be measured in money or in any meaningful way, but
it&#39;ll help you get loyal customers. Knowing that you&#39;re willing to help no
matter the problem gives every customer the incentive to come back for more.</p>

<p>But most importantly, <strong>great customer support makes your customers feel like
they&#39;re treated as humans.</strong></p>
