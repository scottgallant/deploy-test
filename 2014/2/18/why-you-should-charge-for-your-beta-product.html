      <p>There&#39;s a curious assumption out there, and it&#39;s time to put that assumption to
rest for good.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the assumption that <strong>things should be free while they&#39;re in beta.</strong></p>

<p>That assumption is made on both ends, your customers think it should be free,
and you think your product should be free too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bollocks. <strong>You&#39;re hurting your business by following down this path</strong>,
and, while they have good intentions, so are your customers.</p>

<p><strong>Free customers don&#39;t validate a business</strong>, they don&#39;t validate a product.
Only when customers are willing to open their wallet for your product will you
start to have validation that you might be on to something.</p>

<p>Offering a product for free while it&#39;s in beta implies the assumption that the
product doesn&#39;t provide any value while it&#39;s in beta. If your product doesn&#39;t
provide any value while it&#39;s in beta, stop what you&#39;re working on right now.</p>

<p>You think your product doesn&#39;t provide any value while it&#39;s in beta, and neither
do your customers. At least that&#39;s how the assumption goes.</p>

<p>Are you sure that you&#39;ve verified that there&#39;s a market, an audience, for your
product that needs this problem solved? Is there more research you can do? Could
you talk to one of the folks trying out your product?</p>

<p>If you can be sure that your product provides value, and this is why serving
businesses is a much better idea than serving consumers, why are you not
charging for it?</p>

<p>Does the label beta keep you from charging money? Remove it.</p>

<p>The sooner you start charging, the sooner two things will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You know that your product has value</strong> to the customers that are willing to
pay you for it.</li>
<li>Your business has a much higher likelihood of succeeding. <strong>Early validation
gives you confidence that it&#39;s worth continuing with the product.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When we started out with our product version of <a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis
CI</a>, we took a few months to develop what we considered
to be the minimum features we could ship and throw at potential customers.</p>

<p>We launched our initial private beta in July 2012. We started charging in
September 2012. But, and this is where we could&#39;ve done better, we didn&#39;t
enforce charging. If people didn&#39;t want to sign up, they could continue using
the product for free.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we manually emailed dozens of customers, asking them to sign up for a
subscription and for feedback at the same time. This was a long process, and I
wish we&#39;d have automated sooner.</p>

<p>But it gave us a chance to see what people liked, what they didn&#39;t like. At the
end of the manual process we had 100 paying customers. More than enough to
validate that we were on to something.</p>

<p>A beta product doesn&#39;t make a product, let alone a business, yet.</p>

<p>But <strong>when you start charging early, and you find customers paying for it, you
have a tiny validation that it&#39;s valuable</strong> to some. That can be a much more
powerful realization and boost than trying to crank out new features to make
free users happy.</p>

<p><strong>The best way to validate a product is to get a customer to pay for it</strong>, then
10 customers, 100 customers.</p>
