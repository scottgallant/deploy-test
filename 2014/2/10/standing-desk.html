<p>Last year I didn&#39;t feel overly productive for a big part of my day.</p>

<p>I was working mostly from the kitchen table, although I had a dedicated office
at home. It was inhabited for a long time as a guest room, but that&#39;s no excuse.</p>

<p>When I sit at my kitchen table, I lack focus. Without focus, I don&#39;t feel like I
get anything done, especially with more distractions around.</p>

<h3>Bad habits stick around</h3>

<p>What&#39;s worse, I never really got up again once I sat down. That&#39;s a terrible
habit. Just after I took my daughter to the kindergarten, I sat down, did things
without knowing exactly what, and at some point nine to ten hours later, I got
up again, feeling confused and wondering where time went and what I did with it.</p>

<p>We moved into a new apartment a year ago, and I&#39;ve long since had plans to build
a nice standing desk in my home office. It never really came to that. Initially
I wanted to have something that&#39;s not just a hack, something permanent. Then, I
wanted to have something pretty as well, maybe hand-crafted, too.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, with the habit of just sitting down at the kitchen table, it
never really got to that, and I found enough reasons not to have a standing
desk.</p>

<p>It was frustrating, because I knew one thing: I was able to focus a lot better
when I work at a standing desk. Hard to say why, but it made me much happier
working on one.</p>

<h3>IKEA to the rescue</h3>

<p>So one day, I came across this great little hack with just some simple IKEA
parts. <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">A standing desk for
$22</a>
(thanks, Colin of <a href="https://customer.io">customer.io</a>!).</p>

<p>Rather than wait for something fancy to come along (it currently doesn&#39;t fit my
budget too), I decided to run for it, went to IKEA, bought the parts, and
assembled it at home.</p>

<p>My office is rather bright, and we have a white desk, so I went for an all white
version of it using these parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50272376/#/20011413">LACK table, white</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10143211/#/90145579">EKBY STILIG console, white, 26cm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10104813/">ANTONIUS shelf, white, 79x28cm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The setup is assembled in just a few minutes, all you need extra is a few
screws. It&#39;s pretty ingenious. The total cost comes down to € 22,49.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the prettiest standing desk setup, but it&#39;ll do for the time being. It
certainly fits my budget a lot better than anything else.</p>

<h3>Standing all day, every day.</h3>

<p>The first week at the desk was brutal. When I do work on a standing desk, I need
to stand up all day. As soon as I sit down, I know that I&#39;ll slack again.</p>

<p>Standing all day can be a challenge, but I&#39;ve done it before, so I know what to
expect.</p>

<h3>Does it make you more productive?</h3>

<p>It&#39;s hard to describe why a standing desk makes me more productive. It doesn&#39;t
solve all my problems for slacking off, I also need to learn to focus again.</p>

<p>But I feel like I can do that a lot better when I&#39;m standing in my office. Of
course it also helps that you can dance while you work.</p>

<p>One important benefit is that I actively move away from the computer to think
about something. Last year, I mostly sat in front of my screen, which didn&#39;t
gave me a lot of dedicated time to actively contemplate an issue.</p>

<p>I encourage you to try it out. Standing up all day can be tough at first, but
I&#39;m much happier working like that. Plus, when you finally switch off at night,
you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;ve done more than just think and type.</p>
