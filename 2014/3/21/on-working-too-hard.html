      <p>There&#39;s a prevailing idea when it comes to startups and building and running
your own business.</p>

<p>The idea that to be successful, you need to work hard, put in long hours, and
push your team to the limit as well.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the competition, trying to make your customers happy, your
investors too, and trying everything you can to turn your business venture into
a success, however that is defined.</p>

<p>Some companies even go as far as advertising it as normal that you can just take
your work everywhere you go, to the park, to your kids&#39; soccer game, maybe even
to the pub?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve fallen into this trap, I&#39;ve been putting in 10-12 hours per day, working
from home, with my family around. The family is understanding, but that doesn&#39;t
justify these kinds of working hours.</p>

<p>As someone working on a product that&#39;s used around the globe and at every hour
of the day, I can relate to this idea. When production is broken, it&#39;s handy to
have something around to respond. When a customer is having troubles, I want to
help them. I&#39;m used to taking my computer with me, even during the weekends.</p>

<p>Adding to that, with customers only coming online when it&#39;s the end of the
business day in Europe, our support usually ramps up in the later hours, where
customers come into our live chat and expect someone to help them with their
problem.</p>

<p>Helping customers succeed is one of the most important purposes of a business,
and we&#39;re trying as best as we can to help them out.</p>

<p>But that thought drove me into a habit that&#39;s hard to break free from. It&#39;s the
fear that there could be a new customer support issue every day, that there
could be a new customer in the live chat that needs help.</p>

<p>This very habit has driven me to being on the computer from the morning to the
evening hours, always waiting for someone to approach us with an issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a habit that&#39;s been having a very destructive effect on my work and my
life, and the two are not the same.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, as our team grew more and more, I&#39;ve come to the realization
that working longer hours gives a bad example, not just for myself, but it sets
an implicit expectation that others on the team work just as long. It&#39;s poison
for a team for even one person, in particular a manager, to work longer hours.
It gives the impression that it&#39;s normal and expected to work longer than what
your contract says.</p>

<p>It wears people out, it&#39;s worn me out, on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>We recently started doing support rotation, where everyone gets a dedicated
day of doing customer support, escalating to others on the team where
necessary. That gives the support person the freedom to only focus on
customers for the entire day, and it gives the rest of the team the ability to
focus on getting other work done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been effective for us, and it&#39;s already improved our own tooling, our
user interface and our documentation.</p>

<p>But I still can&#39;t shake the habit of always wanting to help. You can say that
it&#39;s a noble habit to have, but its downsides are starting to show.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a quote from <a href="http://amzn.to/1hOnAXC">Small Giants</a> that stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all the extraordinary service and enlightened hospitality that the small
giants offer, what really sets them apart is their belief that the customer
comes second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A company&#39;s team is what sets it apart. That team needs to be well rested to
make for happy customer.</p>

<p>The only way to get them to do that is to discourage long working hours.</p>

<p>In our company, that starts with me.</p>

<p>Success doesn&#39;t depend on how much you work, it depends on where you focus your
time in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t work too hard. </p>
