      <title>Reading List 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/12/30/reading-list-2015.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/12/30/reading-list-2015.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of 2015, and in the tradition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/12/30/reading-list-2013.html&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/30/reading-list-2014.html&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, here’s my reading list, clocking in at 36 books I’ve read this year. I’ve been enjoying reading more and more with every year, and I’ll set the bar at reading at least 40 books in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these books are focused on leadership and organizational topics, which have become more and more interesting to me, so there’s not a lot of technical books in the list, they’re more focused at management, people, growth, organizational health and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU27AX&quot;&gt;Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best…and Learn from the Worst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a follow-up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YR8zOA&quot;&gt;“The No-Asshole Rule”&lt;/a&gt;, a book I read in 2014, and it’s a great collection of examples from good bosses and bad bosses (big surprise!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s usually not easy to come by honest and real world examples like these in a book, so if you want to learn what it takes to be a good boss, and how not to be a bad boss, this is a good book to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few essence pieces in here that point to Rob Sutton’s later work “Scaling Up Excellence”, but I found “Good Boss, Bad Boss” to be a lot more useful and less pretentious than “Scaling Up Excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU28VN&quot;&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read Stephenson’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1OmFvrh&quot;&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; years ago, and this was recommended to me as another of his books to read. The story paints quite an amazing and futuristic picture, given that this book is from 1984. Pictures of the internet, and something like Second Life pop up in what appears like some post-apocalyptic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get much out of reading this book, though, it felt more like a chore than it felt enticing. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU29Jc&quot;&gt;Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Roach has an incredible skill when it comes to dissecting scientific topics in a humorous ways. Just like when reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU3C2g&quot;&gt;“Gulp”&lt;/a&gt; last year, I found myself chuckling and laughing at topics that would appear pretty dry an empty (pun intended) in any other context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2agc&quot;&gt;Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve enjoyed reading Michael Lewis’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU3z6u&quot;&gt;“Flash Boys”&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, so I gave Moneyball a shot. He has a good writing style that keeps you engaged, even when the topic is something mundane as baseball and using metrics and data to make business decisions, especially to a European like myself, who doesn’t have anything on baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the story is a really interesting one, and it’s at times hard to believe how reluctant baseball as a whole is to changing the way it measures success in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2awN&quot;&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was browsing through some classics in the Kindle store, and this came up, so I thought, why not? Turns out it’s a thought-provoking read to boot, definitely among the books one should be reading in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2cES&quot;&gt;Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has gotten me to appreciate the food I eat every day a lot more, and the path it’s taken to where we are right now, both the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an inspiring story to look after what you eat and look beyond just eating healthy, but also considering where your food is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the book had me wanting to make my own salami and grow more of our food ourselves, so that’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an inspiring and thought-provoking read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2efS&quot;&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the few novels I’ve read this year, and it turned out to be a great one. It only took me two days to read the entire book, and it was really hard to put down. It’s a mystery thriller kind of book with a well laid out and gripping story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for any kind of novel to read, go for this one, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU1Uhn&quot;&gt;Startup CEO: How to Build a Company to Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only few books that focus on what a CEO in a startup or relatively young but fast-growing company does. It focuses a lot on the every day in and outs of a CEO, and it helped me quite a lot in getting a grip on what I should be focusing on as a CEO, what I can and should delegate, what roles to hire into, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in the rare position of being the CEO of a startup, this is one of the books to get. It’s right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1OmFeok&quot;&gt;“The Hard Thing About Hard Things”&lt;/a&gt;, and I have both on my desk in print for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2f3p&quot;&gt;The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had this book on my reading list for two or three years, and it was about time to finally read it. It was time well spent. The Phoenix Project is very well written, outlining organizational dysfunctions and the path to improvement as a novel rather than a collection of practices or things you could or should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked in similar organizations as outlined in the book and having seen what can help improve them, I could relate to a lot of what’s in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good part is that it’s not just a book for ops or development folks. DevOps is about more than that, it’s about customer focus and organizational health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It quickly made it on our company-internal book recommendation list for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2god&quot;&gt;Mindset: How You Can Fulfil Your Potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mindset” looks at two different states of mind. One is the fixed and the other the growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book looks at both from different angles, work, sports, personal life, marriage, children, making the case that the fixed mindset will keep you from becoming a better person, from learning, from growing into something rather than relying on superfluous (or non-existent) things like talent, being born with a certain trait, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the right mindset (spoiler: it’s the growth mindset), you can learn pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a rather motivational book, which got me to rethink a lot of my approaches to life, both personally and at work, so it was worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2ifO&quot;&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is written in a similar way as &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2f3p&quot;&gt;“The Phoenix Project”&lt;/a&gt; (though I’d wager that it’s the other way around). It’s the story of a new CEO joining a struggling company and trying to find out what’s broken in the leadership team and working towards fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself slapping my forehead quite a few times reading this book, and I’d recommend it to anyone in a leadership position, though it makes for great and revelatory reading for everyone working in a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.io/books/product-management&quot;&gt;Intercom on Product Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A handy little guide from the folks at Intercom on the how and why of product management, on figuring out what to build and what not to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2lbe&quot;&gt;Veins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This novel-ish book gets a mention here mostly because I read it, and that’s it. It’s neither particularly thrilling nor is it exciting or humorous. I just found it sad to read, but maybe that’s what the author intended, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2lbu&quot;&gt;The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book picks up where &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2ifO&quot;&gt;“The Five Dysfunctions of a Team”&lt;/a&gt; left off. It outlines clear advice on how to get a team to focus and to fix its dysfunctions. The fixes outlined in this book are surprisingly simple, and I can confirm that I’ve tried a few of them out already, to great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading “The Five Dysfunctions”, you should be reading this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2njr&quot;&gt;Making It Right: Product Management for a Startup World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another relatively short and approachable book on product management, and very much focused on the practical side of it, and how it might work in an engineering organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather helpful if you want to figure out what product management is, how to approach it and where it might sit in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2lYR&quot;&gt;The Wind-up Bird Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of Murakami’s books and his writing style, and this one was a great read, as to be expected. One of the few novels I’ve read in 2015, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7213&quot;&gt;My Life and Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say this was an out-of-the-ordinary book with the others mentioned in this list, but it really wasn’t. This is Henry Ford’s auto-biography with a heavy focus on how he’s built his business building and selling cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some noteworthy key points: instead of taking funding, he built his business brick by brick, building and selling several different car models until he’s finally reached the infamous Model T, which he turned into multiple revenue streams, being able to turn the base structure of the car into cars, convertibles, trucks, tractors, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While he’s considered the father of integrated factories that build cars  on an assembly line, I found some of his views on building a business rather surprising, positively so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hired people no matter their background, assuming that everyone wanted to come to work to do a great job. He restricted work to a reasonable set of hours. He built factories that, while compact, made sure that there’s enough room for people to move about without feeling crammed and that have enough natural light rather than feeling closed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a surprisingly good book to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything that Ford valued made it into the future, though. His prediction was that cities would vanish, and that people would favor a lifestyle of living in the countryside, where they could grow their own crops in summer and work in factories like Ford’s in winter. Not really that bad of an idea, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2oEe&quot;&gt;Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was recommended to me when looking for books on management, so I gave it a read. I’ve been an avid reader of &lt;a href=&quot;http://randsinrepose.com&quot;&gt;Michael Lopp’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, so this seemed like a useful book to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn’t really get much out of it. The book reads exactly like what it is, a collection of blog posts, loosely grouped around similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find some entertainment in Lopp’s writing style on his blog, though I do find it a bit glorified (both when talking about engineers and engineering managers) and pretentious at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collected blog post content doesn’t really jell, it doesn’t flow well from one chapter to the next. It’s like reading a collection of blog posts, which you might as well do on &lt;a href=&quot;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/category/management/&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU23RJ&quot;&gt;Zero to One: Notes on Startups and How to Build the Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the celebrated books on startups coming out in 2014, so I thought, why not? Let’s see what Peter Thiel has to say. Given the companies he’s been involved and invested in, he probably knows a thing or two on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s been rather critical of the funding-heavy startup culture of San Francisco and Silicon Valley, I tried to approach this book with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Thielian Reality (you heard it here first) conflicts deeply with how I view building a business. His focus is on building monopolies, unicorns, companies that dominate markets, and therefore determine the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire book talks about companies that have grown very fast, that have captured huge markets, companies that have broken or build monopolies. They do exist, there’s no denying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find Thiel’s advice as a whole to be rather toxic. His reality is a perfect outline of how I perceive Silicon Valley, which is good when you’re part of that culture. It’s repelling to me as someone so removed from that culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book finishes by describing that founders need to be on the extreme end with their personal trait. He brings in Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, and other pop culture heroes to make his case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiel’s Reality is a very one-side one, and I want as little part of it as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU20p9&quot;&gt;Hot Seat: The Startup CEO Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book came fresh off the press, and it was recommended to me by a friend. As books on being a startup CEO are rare, I had to read this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really well written, and it’s full of good advice when you’re starting up a company. The first part focuses heavily on topics like founding and how to split up the company, approaching funding, getting investors on board, pitching, and so on. I found this part very interesting to read as someone who’s so removed from all of that. On the other hand, this topic makes up almost half of the book, and it’s heavily leaning towards setting up your company in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much content focused on founding and funding, I felt like the rest fell a bit short. Management and leadership get their due pages, and so does the topic of acquisition, but they do feel unfinished, especially compared to how dense the part on founding and funding is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perception, the book is great for when you’re just starting out. There are a few things in there, especially from the early stages, and the end bits about going through an acquisition, that I found rather interesting and that got me to dive into other books the author mentioned to learn more. They’re stories that you don’t hear about very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points for this book focusing so much on the importance of diversity in a startup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this if you’re just starting out setting up a company. At later stages, go for “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” and “Startup CEO”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2qvD&quot;&gt;Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be one of the best and most insightful books I’ve read in 2015, recommended by a friend. I’ve read Tom DeMarco’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1OmRVQ2&quot;&gt;“Peopleware”&lt;/a&gt;, a project management and software engineering classic, years ago, and it was already a very insightful book, so reading this one seemed like a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s wonderfully short, and it’s easy to read the entire thing in an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the book is that it’s important not to keep yourself (as a manager) and your team busy and working at full capacity. Doing that restricts your team and company in experimenting and innovating, leaving little room to find new ways of doing things, exploring new features or even new products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a manager or leader, this is a must-read book. And when I say must-read, I mean must-read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2qMg&quot;&gt;Startupland: How Three Guys Risked Everything to Turn an Idea Into a Global Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startupland is the story of how Zendesk, a widely respected company in customer support, grew from three guys in a Copenhagen apartment to going public on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasant story to read, and it’s an honest one too. It touches on struggles in the founding team just as much as the struggles of scaling out a company, working with investors, moving countries as a company, and finally, about going public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much in terms of advice in here, it’s just a nice story to read on how you can grow a company from the very small to the very big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU24Fk&quot;&gt;The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the books recommended in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU20p9&quot;&gt;“Hot Seat”&lt;/a&gt;, and it was one of the few books that I devoured and thoroughly enjoyed reading, having many facepalm and lightbulb moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the few (maybe the only?) books that dives into real world data on startups. The data set feels a bit outdated (at least speaking in terms of internet time), but it still gives you good indicators on what you need to focus on and keep in mind when you start a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It touches on topics like splitting up equity, balancing (or rather, choosing one or the other), keeping control of the company versus building wealth, taking on investors, challenges and struggles of a founding team, and heaps more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a treasure trove, and I wish I’d read it years ago (or at least in 2012, when it came out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning on setting up a company, if you’re just setting one up, or even if you’re years into building it, this book is a must-read for an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s helped me gain some clarity on topics that I couldn’t quite put my finger on before or argue for against, and that’s true for every topic it touches on. Quite a few of the problems outlined are familiar to me, and it was interesting to learn how this has panned out at hundreds or thousands of other companies in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, an investor asked me “Do you want to be rich or do you want to be the king?” Back then, I didn’t really understand what he’d meant. Thanks to this book, I have a much better understanding about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU20FD&quot;&gt;Venture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another book coming out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU20p9&quot;&gt;“Hot Seat”&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to read on a whim. I’m a critical person of the prevailing funding culture, but I still wanted to learn more about what’s happening inside that other reality, so I can at least understand it better, maybe open up my mind along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sure helped to read this book. It’s straight to the point, and if you’re looking into getting funding for your company, you’d probably be well-advised to read it. Though you shouldn’t really take that from me, as I have very little experience looking for let alone going through the process of getting funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It definitely helped me get some more insight into funding from an investor’s perspective, which was helpful after getting the founder’s perspective in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU20p9&quot;&gt;“Hot Seat”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2sDW&quot;&gt;What if?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being an avid read of xkcd, it took me a while to get to the point of wanting to read this book. I’m glad that I did, because it’s hilarious. It starts out by explaining what it would look like if a baseball was pitched at near light speed, and it just goes from one hysterical and outrageously impossible topic to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed a lot reading this book, so you should probably read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2ueM&quot;&gt;Beyond Blame: Learning from Failure and Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of reviewing this book as it was written by my friend Dave Zwieback. It follows the footsteps of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2ifO&quot;&gt;“Five Dysfunctions of a Team”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2f3p&quot;&gt;“The Phoenix Project”&lt;/a&gt;, using a novel-like narrative to explain the importance of a blameless organizational culture and trusting your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a wonderful and short read, so you should probably read it. If you’re new to the topics of blameless culture, normalization of deviance, practical drift, the ETTO principle, and the like, you’ll find plenty of inspiration and starting points in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2uvp&quot;&gt;The Road to Little Dribbling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a big fan of Bill Bryson’s books, having racked up quite the stack over the years. “The Road to Little Dribbling” picks up where “Notes from a Small Island” left off, revisiting Britain 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the book rather disappointing. While it still has heaps of Bryson’s witty and humorous writing style, a big part of it reads like the ramblings of an old man who’s mad at how things have changed since he was last in the country. Maybe he’s right in being mad, but there are so many complaints in the book, it’s been a bit dreadful to read at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the same as “Notes from a Small Island”, or any of his other, previous books. If there’s one thing I appreciate out of this book as much as his earlier works, it’s that he walks around so much to explore. I can certainly relate to and appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2tHM&quot;&gt;The Martian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw posters of some movie called “The Martian” feat. Matt Damon, so I did the only thing I could think of and bought the book so I don’t have to go to the movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great novel, both for the geek in me (and you!), and for the hopeful person, and you should probably read it. It’s interspersed with scientific detail, and you can tell that the author did their homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2v2B&quot;&gt;Marissa Mayer and the Fight to Save Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the introduction to this book earlier this year, and that got me hooked on wanting to read more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is part a history of Google and part a history of Yahoo!, both sides with a focus on Mayer’s role in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly well written, and I had a hard time putting it down (so I didn’t!) It’s odd to call a book like this gripping, but that’s exactly what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at recent news out of and around Yahoo!, the story isn’t finished yet, but it’s a great introduction to where Yahoo!, Google and Mayer came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/inceptions&quot;&gt;Inceptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recommended this to me to find some inspiration on how to approach our company offsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inceptions is a workshop method to plan a product, or the next quarter of it, working through features, their motivations, goals and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was not the kind of thing I’d planned on doing at our company offsite, this is sure to be helpful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2vzB&quot;&gt;A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a movie poster that had Robert Redford on it, and I thought “Hey, I’ve heard that movie title before!” Once again, I did the only thing I could think of and bought the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is from 1998, and it does read like it at times, but it’s written by the wonderfully humorous and witty Bill Bryson that I’ve come to enjoy a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a story to indulge in without clinging to any of the detail, just living through what Bryson has experienced walking the Appalachian Trail, making you dream about maybe doing that Trail yourself one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2xY1&quot;&gt;Stir: My Broken Brain and the Meals That Brought Me Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was written by my friend Jessica Fechtor, and it’s a mix of personal story interspersed with food and recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy reading these kinds of books, and even more so when I know the author personally, as the stories here share so much more about their personal lives, bits that I didn’t know of. It makes me appreciate them as friends even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like these kinds of books, may I also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YR5Q7F&quot;&gt;Luisa Weiss’ “My Berlin Kitchen”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YR5Lkv&quot;&gt;Molly Wizenberg’s “A Homemade Life”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2w6t&quot;&gt;Girl in a Band&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Kim Gordon’s memoir. She was a founding member of Sonic Youth, she directed heaps of music videos, is an artist, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my grunge days, I didn’t really listen to Sonic Youth, which maybe helped me appreciate this book and Kim’s many talents a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of this book is about feminism, being the girl in a band, being a rock mother, and the struggles going along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an inspiring book to read and has gotten me wanting to read more biographies and more personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2ziE&quot;&gt;The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this book often enough that I figured I might as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, there’s very little in terms of technical details in here. The story starts at Ada Lovelace and follows the path towards computing and computers as we know it to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path is fascinating, and it’s filled with amazing and smart people building on top of each other’s work, triggering innovation after innovation, to get us to where we are now with computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most inspiring part of the book was to me that it only talks about people and how they work together. The innovations that have lead us to where we are now in computers were more team work than they were an individual’s achievements, even if some of the individuals involved would like to tell a different tale. It tells the stories of unlikely couples working together, playing off each other’s strength to build transistors, computers, microchips and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the first part to be the one I enjoyed the most, because I knew very little about Ada Lovelace and her involvement in defining computing today, and I was happy to have that fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If computers and how they came about are your thing, this is a good book to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1OmCgjO&quot;&gt;Managing Oneself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was my first contact with Peter Drucker, and it got me hooked on reading more. It’s really, really short, really. You can read it in half an hour. It’s still full of great advice on the importance of managing yourself, figuring out your values, your strengths, what you’re not good at, and how you can measure your own success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title suggest it’s aimed at managers, but he’s talking to anyone who can be considered a knowledge worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the book is that it’s just as important to reflect on yourself as it is to reflect on the bigger picture you’re a part of. That message I’ll gladly sign off on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1YU2CuY&quot;&gt;How We Got to Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this book on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainpickings.org&quot;&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; and, having an appreciation for learning about how things came about that we consider part of our everyday life now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Johnson talks about six innovations, some of them arguably under-appreciated, that have lead us to where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innovations he talks about are glass, cold, sound, clean, time and light. If you think about it, at the surface, all of them sound so minuscule, hardly worth calling innovations, let alone innovations that have had a key part in getting us to where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the book reads like it suffers from outcome bias, but on the other hand, Johnson is probably right that our civilization wouldn’t be exactly where it is right now without the innovations he introduces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this a fascinating book to read. If you’d like to learn more about sleep and time in particular, I have two book recommendations for you: &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1zpQwNb&quot;&gt;”Dreamland”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1zpQDby&quot;&gt;“In Search of Time”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What books did you read in 2015? Make sure to share your list, so the rest of us can make sure we never run out of interesting things to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in 2016! I already got my reading list for the first couple of weeks sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: All links are Amazon Associates links, the earnings of which I solely use to buy more books. I appreciate your using them and feeding my unhealthy reading habit, thank you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Most Important Thing About 1:1s (and Building Trust)</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/6/the-most-important-thing-about-one-on-ones.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/6/the-most-important-thing-about-one-on-ones.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slightly more than a year ago, I had no idea what a 1:1 is let alone what purpose it’s serves. The idea of talking to one of our team member seemed so foreign at a time when we structured our team around individual autonomy and the assumption that people will speak up when something’s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I quickly learned is that unless you give them a forum and safe space for it, they won’t. They’ll keep their unhappiness, grievances and issues to themselves until it’s too late, and that’s to no fault of their own. When there’s no clear and regular place for you as a person to talk about what’s bothering you, there’s little reason for you to bring it up in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, 1:1s have become one of the most important interactions we foster with our team at Travis CI. It doesn’t just give a forum for people to talk about what’s bothering them, and to give you (the manager) a place to help them with their personal and professional growth. It gives invaluable face time in a team that’s now about 50% remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, one of the most important things about 1:1s is to simply show up, to be there, to listen, to embrace the awkward pause. That alone helps you (the manager) build trust with people on your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1:1 doesn’t end when the allotted time is up, not for you, not for the person you’ve had the 1:1 with. It’s your job as a manager to figure out what’s moving, motivating and bothering the people on your team, and a 1:1 is a great place to talk about these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation, however, has to continue. Whatever issues, questions or problems came out of a 1:1, it’s your job as the manager to follow up on those issues. Whether that happens via email, a brief conversation or in the next 1:1, the medium itself isn’t important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up on things coming out of 1:1 is the single best way for you as the manager to build trust with your team. When you follow up on what you say you will, your team will have confidence in you, they’ll trust you, they know that you care about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling in time for follow up can be challenging, especially with our constant state of busyness, regardless of what our job is. Finding the time for it and following through with it, though, is the single best thing you can do to build trust with your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, there’s more. Following up isn’t just important for managers, it’s important for everyone participating in them. Trust goes both ways. When you agree on things to follow up on for both of you, it’s a mutual commitment to each other, to building a trusting relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit where credit is due: I’ve learned a lot about 1:1s from Jason Evanish’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonevanish.com/2014/06/27/what-to-expect-when-you-start-having-1-on-1s/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/15/3-keys-to-starting-to-do-1-on-1s-with-your-team/&quot;&gt;on the topic&lt;/a&gt; and also his recent writing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getlighthouse.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Lighthouse blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getlighthouse.com/&quot;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool I’ve been using for the past year or so that helps with tracking notes and action items coming out 1:1s, I’d highly recommend you check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fear of Failure Can Be Paralyzing</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/5/the-fear-of-failure.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/5/the-fear-of-failure.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend recently approached me, asking how he could overcome a feeling of paralysis. He felt stuck figuring out what the next steps are in getting his product out and front of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can very much relate to that feeling, it’s been a continuous companion over the last 3+ years in building out Travis CI. While I didn’t have any good advice, I had a few stories of my own to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 I was working on our billing app. It didn&amp;#39;t feel that important, but when you think about it, it&amp;#39;s kind of an important piece of making money for a SaaS product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt continuously stuck and afraid to finish it up, paralyzed by the fear that it would break and that it wouldn&amp;#39;t work for weird reasons. In some ways I felt like I over-engineered it, just to make sure it&amp;#39;s resilient enough to all the weird stuff that happens with payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing it up and bringing it to a state where I could confidently say &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s do this!&amp;quot; took me the better of two months. While we weren&amp;#39;t sure if the product is stable enough (it wasn&amp;#39;t) to justify charging for it, we tried to do it anyway, and we went into a private beta for months. We made it a paid one, a generally unheard-of concept in a world where beta usually means free, or where services remain in perpetual beta state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar thing happened when we decided on and published our pricing, which was deliberately higher than that of our competition, and there were public complaints about it. We were still confident, but that kind of negative feedback hampered us. We got over that hill in the end, and decided on just pushing through with the pricing and see where it leads us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time this happened was when we were faced with the question of how long we want our private beta to continue. We were in private beta for almost a year, which is ridiculous in hindsight. There were so many things we were worried about, mostly regarding capacity and not being able to support the onslaught of customers, it kept us from making the call. In the end, getting our of private beta and opening up the product to everyone gave us a huge spurt in new customers, and from thereon out we saw organic and steady growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you step into unknown territory, the paralysis is a natural thing to happen. When you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen, the simplest thing for us is to stay away from taking the plunge. I know this feeling very well, and I&amp;#39;m finding myself faced with it again right now. It gets even harder when it stops just being you, and when other people’s income and supporting their families is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found to be useful in those situations is to think about what it is that I&amp;#39;m really afraid of, what&amp;#39;s the worst that could happen in the situation I feel so paralyzed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the worst part that no one&amp;#39;s going to give us money? Is the worst part that the billing system might fail and people can&amp;#39;t give us money? Is the worst that we’ll have some unhappy customers, or an unhappy team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about that nudges yourself to think about your fear and your paralysis, and to think about what you’re really afraid of rather than just feeling stuck by the fear itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear of failure and the accompanying paralysis seeps through all aspects of your business. When it’s not about the billing system, it’s about where to go with the product, figuring out what to do next. 
The product will never be finished, it will never be good enough for you, in particular for you who&amp;#39;ve invested so much into it. This alone can lead you to a perpetual state of not being able to move when move is the very thing you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channeled right, this can be a powerful driver and motivation. But it can also be a constant feeling of not achieving everything you want to achieve. For this situation, the simplest thing you can ask yourself is: what&amp;#39;s the simplest thing I can add and ship for this to be (more) useful and valuable to someone? It&amp;#39;s not a definition of finished, but it&amp;#39;s a definition of good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find a few folks to give you money for that, then you&amp;#39;re on a great path, and it’s the most powerful motivator from hereon out. Can you get 10 customers to give you money? Can you get 100? 1000?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the moment where you&amp;#39;ll end up feeling silly about your paralysis. That moment when your first customer, your first ten customers, give you their credit card and their money, that&amp;#39;s the best moment. It&amp;#39;s not a guarantee what you&amp;#39;ve built is going to be successful in the long run, but it&amp;#39;s incredibly validating and motivating for you to push on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that the feeling of paralysis is probably never going to go away. As your business grows, you’ll continuously be faced with new decisions whose outcome you cannot foresee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you will get better at is getting a grasp of what you’re really afraid of and, most importantly, at recovering from when things go wrong. You’ll be more resilient to these failures over time, and you’ll find ways to pick yourself up again and move on, learning as you go. The truth is that you’re not alone in this fear and paralysis. It happens to a lot of people in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to figure out how to get over it is to find people who are or have been in similar situations as you are now. Ask them how they felt, ask them what they did to get out of the paralysis, and find comfort in the fact that you’re not alone. If you ever feel like you need someone to chat to, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:meyer@paperplanes.de&quot;&gt;feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently listened &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reboot.io/episode/13-you-are-not-alone-in-the-fear-with-ben-rubin/&quot;&gt;to a podcast on the topic of fear and founders&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;d recommend you listen to it and think about how it applies to you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Be a Better Listener, Embrace the Awkward Pause</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/1/embrace-the-awkward-pause.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/10/1/embrace-the-awkward-pause.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I met one of our team members in person for the first time. We hung out for the entire day, talking about all kinds of things, problems we were facing with our company at the time were amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During those conversations he taught me a simple yet rather powerful conversation technique: the awkward pause. It’s since become an important tool for me in 1:1s and conversations with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you talk about a problematic topic, there tends to be that moment when the other party stops talking. It can happen for lots of reasons. They don’t want to rat someone out, they don’t want to vent, they’re looking for the right words to express themselves, or the topic is so uncomfortable that they don’t want to continue talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re impatient, it’s tempting to pick up the conversation in those moments. You ask further questions, you start talking about your point of view, you possibly even change the topic thinking that there’s not much more to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our intuition makes the awkward pause weird for both of us. It feels uncomfortable because no one is talking when this entire meeting is about talking, exchanging ideas and thoughts. The temptation to chime in and take over the conversation is big. Nobody likes the awkward pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you chime in and interrupt the awkward pause, breaking this uncomfortable silence, the topic likely drops off the other person’s mind. Whatever troubles they’ve had, they’re unlikely to come up again in this meeting. They’re more likely to come up in some future conversation, when that person has gotten to a point where the topic has made them so unhappy that it turns into a vent, or maybe even in their resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interrupting the awkward pause means losing out on invaluable information and insight. What comes after the awkward pause is usually the real issues on that person’s mind. Whether what you’re going to hear is actionable or not, a vent, a personal issue, it’s the underlying issue of everything else you’ve talked about up until this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the essence of what the conversation is all about. Breaking out of the awkward pause makes sure that essence is lost forever, possibly never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find yourself in a conversation and you can feel that you’re in an awkward pause moment, take a deep breath, focus on the other person and just wait. Resist the urge to continue the conversation and let the other person continue digging up the real issue that’s on their mind. Resist the urge to break out of the awkwardness and just let the other person talk when they’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing the awkward pause is possibly one of the simplest and most effective tools to make you a better listener. It helps you build trust and develop more patience in conversations with your reports and your peers. I’d go as far as considering it an essential leadership skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Dan, for teaching me an invaluable skill!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Habits of an Introverted Leader</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/30/five-habits-introverted-leader.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/30/five-habits-introverted-leader.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being an introverted person in a leadership position is challenging. The one thing that exhaust you the most is now your main focus, interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I didn’t fully realize that I have introverted tendencies until I read the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1KVJHgd&quot;&gt;“Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&amp;#39;t Stop Talking”&lt;/a&gt;. I’d considered myself shy before then, feeling awkward trying to strike up smalltalk conversations, even just talking to other people, and constantly feeling a need to hide in quiet places to get away from chatter and to focus on my own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chalked it all up to being shy, and it left me in an uncomfortable position. Am I confident enough that I can pull out the relevant skills to be the CEO of an entire company, especially the people part?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I identified a few routines that helped me balance the needs of being in a leadership position with my introverted nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Read every day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading has become a very important part of my day and my progression from trying to get a startup off the ground to taking on the role of leading said startup as it matured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books have played an important part in helping me shape my own thinking about what I’d like our company to be, and about what I’d like to become. They’ve helped me narrow down on a few problems and helped me focus on solutions for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, taking time to read is also time to reflect. A lot of books I’ve read have given me one or two key realizations about what I need to improve, what I’m doing well, and what our company can do differently. That one spark is worth reading an entire book for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the introvert in me, reading is quiet time. I usually read first thing in the day, before I do anything else, and before the noise of the day starts crowding my mind, distracting it from the focus required to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take long walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started taking walks after I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1PWlGoV&quot;&gt;“Thinking, Fast &amp;amp; Slow”&lt;/a&gt;, which was a revelatory book for me, in terms of understanding myself, our customers and my team. Did I mention that reading is amazing, and that you should read every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, your brain is busy processing information, impressions, conversations, and adding to that, you’re trying to get it to focus on the work that needs to get done. Giving into this feeling of constant busyness is a downward spiral, leading to even more work, feeling stressed out, and emotionally exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this ends up with work trickling into my personal life, be it by keeping my mind busy with work topics when I get home or on weekends, or affecting my moods at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond reading, the best medium I’ve found to let those thoughts loose is to go on walks. Not just 20 minutes walks, but up to an hour. I walk at a relaxes speed and without any particular place in mind that I want to go. When you walk towards something, your mind is focused on that, and it doesn’t free up mental capacity to think and process. When you walk too fast, you may notice similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to walk on familiar paths, a sort of roundtrip through the neighborhood, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, magic happens. My head stops being overly busy, all those thoughts quiet down, and it feels like my head is a lot more responsive to giving it small triggers, like “I wonder what I could write about next?”, or much broader than that, “Containers?” Even small triggers suddenly leave my mind to wander around the topic, looking at different angles, maybe even finding a conclusion. It feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking, all by myself, has turned out to be an important tool in processing information collected throughout the day, week and month, and working on extracting the patterns, the bigger picture, and what I could do about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Schedule time away from the office&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a leader, it’s likely you have a strong urge to always be around your team, being ready to jump in and help them at any time. You may also experience the fear of missing out, always wondering and curious what’s going on in your team, in team chat, and around the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fear and the constant hovering adds to the emotional drain, contributing to a constant feeling of burnout, yet you feel guilty about not being there when your team needs you. It’s too hard to disconnect and focus on yourself and your own work, so that starts slipping and adds more to the constant state of busyness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above scenario isn’t an introvert’s problem, it’s the disease that our modern work day has become. In addition to feeling like I’m not progressing on my own work, this situation added to my own feeling of work topics trickling into my personal life, as little time was left to process all that information and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started scheduling in weekly time away from the office, time that I spend in a coffee shop or elsewhere, noise-canceling headphones plugged in, working on bigger topics or just letting my mind wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, this didn’t feel like work, and I felt guilty, even selfish, for taking this time. But then I realized that I’m actually getting results from this time away from the office. It allows me to progress on important and bigger company topics, yet it gave me the isolated space that my introverted self needs to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking walks, reading and spending time away from the office have become important stop gaps for me. They give me the time and space to process, recharge, figure out the bigger picture and come up with solutions for problems a crowded brain might not otherwise be able to extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Write every day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes struggle forming thoughts into concrete sentences when I talk to people. Part of that is because I’m having trouble forming a complete picture in my head, which I feel I need before I can say something. This reflects in how I approach thinking about bigger company topics as well. I need time and space to form my own opinions on things, and there is one tool that’s been the greatest help for me in this, writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to write, every day. Whether it’s working on a blog post, whether it’s writing an internal proposal, a summary of a call I’ve just had with someone to send around to the team, or simply writing a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done the latter every day for almost two years now, and it’s become an essential part of my every day work. I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dayoneapp.com&quot;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; whose reminders pop up multiple times throughout the day to help me capture what I’m thinking. Longer prose also goes into Day One at times, as some situations warrant a longer thought process, which is effectively reflected in what I write. For anything else, I’ve started trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesapp.com&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, before I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/&quot;&gt;NValt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bywordapp.com&quot;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt; for writing. I enjoy the simplicity of a full screen app with just a cursor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matter what tool you’re using, what matters is that you get beyond that moment of utter fear instilled by a blank screen with a blinking cursor on it and just write down what’s on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing requires me to focus, and it allows me to make sense of all the noise in my head. It’s my one outlet of processing all the information I collect, consciously or not, throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take your time in making decisions, but follow up on them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need time to process information, to figure out any patterns and to come to my own conclusion on it. That process can involve writing, thinking, walking or listening to more opinions, gathering more insight from our diverse team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can sometimes be frustrating for others, especially when they want to move forward with something quickly. There are situations where I can just say “Sounds good.” and trust them with all my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other situations, I make a commitment to get back to them in a certain amount of time. The more you define that amount of time and keep your commitment, the more trust you can build with people over time. When they know that you do follow up and keep your own commitments, they’ll get more used to this being your mode of making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found those two to be a good balance between making sure things don’t get stalled all the time and my own need for thinking things through a bit longer before I can come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond reading, writing, walking and spending time at the office, I’ve started meditating daily to try and tackle another issue I’ve mentioned earlier. Oftentimes I find my mind thinking about work things when I’m at home. I get distracted playing with my daughter, reading a book to her or over dinner, and I have an immediate urge to work on the thing I just thought about. I found that rather frustrating, and I’ve noticed that meditation helps me focus a lot more on the moment rather than have my mind wander endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What helps you foster your introverted nature as a leader? What helps you lead introverted people on your team? &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:meyer@paperplanes.de&quot;&gt;I’d love to hear&lt;/a&gt; about your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Care of Business, Taking Care of Yourself</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/29/taking-care-of-yourself.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/29/taking-care-of-yourself.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, while hanging out with people from a friendly company in San Francisco, one of their junior people asked me a seemingly simple question: “What do you do for fun?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was stunned, and I didn’t have an answer. I didn’t know what I did for fun, and I almost panicked from not being able to come up with something beyond hanging out and spending time with my friends and family outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the real world and at home, I continued pondering this question, and happiness and the simple question of “What do I want?” have become regulars at coaching sessions, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://reboot.io/podcast&quot;&gt;podcasts I listen&lt;/a&gt; to, and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2015/6/2/8686191/happiness-myths&quot;&gt;other articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it took me a while to realize it initially, the biggest part of my job is now to &lt;a href=&quot;http://firstround.com/review/Heres-Why-Founders-Should-Care-about-Happiness/&quot;&gt;make sure that everyone in our company is happy&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been focusing so much on it that I rarely give myself a moment of happiness, or that I take any kind of appreciation for myself. All praise belongs to the team. I devoid from giving any credit to myself, simply because I think I don’t deserve it, other people do. For more on this topic see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/28/always-improve-never-appreciate.html&quot;&gt;previous post on the importance of appreciation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While focusing so much on the company and other people, it’s easy to forget this most important thing in your own life: you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You consider the question of what you want invalid, because you think your existence is to serve others and make them happy. Or you don’t think that you alone deserve anything, instead success and results need to be shared with the team. Claiming anything for yourself feels selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things ring true for me, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a founder, you’re not just financially invested in your own company. No, you want to see this thing succeed, and you want to do everything in your powers to help make it succeed, whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it only takes this one more thing, right? If we can achieve X, then I can finally take a deep breath and take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if after X, suddenly you want to achieve Y? What if X is never achieved, and other circumstances change the goal? What if X takes a lot longer than you thought it would (hint: it always does)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When X doesn’t turn out the way you intended, your original goal is quickly forgotten. It’s just one more step towards taking care of yourself, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Travis CI, my goal was to start looking after myself once Travis CI had reached a certain size. Then I’d finally be able to spend more time with my family and figure out what I can do for fun. That moment never really appeared, at least not in a reasonable time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More growth meant new challenges, new things to learn, new goals to focus on for the company and for my own personal growth in my role. So there it went, moving the goal slightly further into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I set a fixed goal for myself. I had promised my daughter to take her to New Zealand before she goes to school, which is this year, and she’s now in her fourth week. We ended up planning for a seven week trip, which meant seven weeks away from the business. I vowed to be completely offline, to not read any email and avoid any contact with work, focusing on the here and now instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These constraints were harsh, and it posed a challenge to everyone while I was away. Everyone took some bruises, and we learned a lot along the way, we figured out where our company was still hurting and worked on improving these parts. I’m grateful for this experience, and I couldn’t ask for a greater team to handle these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important lesson out of it, though, wasn’t that the business will be better off in the long term based on my being away. The important lesson is that taking time off and away from everything else isn’t selfish, even though it feels like that. It’s about taking care of yourself, which is more important than a lot of founders will be willing to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on yourself means asking what you want, what makes you happy, what you can do for fun. In the early days of building out your business, they will feel like selfish questions, like you don’t deserve anything nice while you build up value for your employees, for your customers, and maybe for your investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to think about yourself, as early on as possible. What you want is just as important as what everyone else wants, and if you don’t take care of yourself early on, you’ll look back at that time with appreciation for what you’ve built, and regret about the things you missed out on personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that taking care of yourself can have positive impact on your company too. Everything you do sets an example, both good and bad. If you work and work and work, everyone else will too. If you find a happy medium between work and life (including personal happiness), everyone in your company will strive to follow your example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I’m still working on the question of what I do for fun. I’ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Always Improve, Never Stop, Never Pause, Never Appreciate</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/28/always-improve-never-appreciate.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/9/28/always-improve-never-appreciate.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building out a company and a business has been my greatest challenge so far. The company’s mission is built around continuous integration and continuous improvement, the constant drive of always getting better at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As engineers, we’re trained to fix bugs, to build out new features, to hold postmortems where we analyze what didn’t work and how we can improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As founders, we follow a similar pattern. We have a ton of ideas on what we want to improve, where we want to get better, what part of the product still isn’t good enough, how many more customers we want in the next 12 months. After all, our product only needs one more feature and it will finally break through, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling up a business is, at least in the early stages, a lot about iterating on the product. We strive towards acquiring more and more customers by building more and more features, and we want to continue doing that, just like we did in the early days, because it worked so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know that feeling? You’re never fully happy with what you have, because you have so many things that you like to improve around the product and around the company. Once you’ve fixed one thing, you move on to the next. It’s a continuous cycle, and vicious one. Nobody deserves to be fully happy until you’ve fixed more things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in this very same cycle, and it’s a downward spiral, especially dangerous when everyone thinks that way. Remember, as a founder, you set the tone in the company more than anyone else. If you always insist on improving, never pausing, everyone else will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s missing in this picture? In the picture, we run from one thing to the next. We’re always running, we barely look back, because we feel looking back isn’t yet warranted, not before we do a few more things. Looking back would feel like standing still, like taking a deep breath, and we don’t have time for that. It’s a competitive market, the next pivot is just around the corner, there are always more reasons to keep on running. You keep running towards an unknown future, barely appreciating what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therein lies the problem. Appreciation feels undeserved, it feels like you’re stalling. You can’t allow yourself to marvel at the thing you’ve built for fear of wasting time not improving that thing, for fear of appearing selfish or bragging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to push further and improve what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you never take the time to appreciate where you are, you’ll be running indefinitely, and you’ll expect everyone on your team to do the same thing. If you don’t pause to celebrate achievements, neither will they.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis CI is now a team of 23 people, it has more than 2000 customers all over the world, and it’s running more than 230.000 build jobs every day. The running self would tell us that we were probably lucky to get here and that we need to continue running to make sure that we can keep and grow those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different kind of me can now pause, take a deep breath and be incredibly proud of what we’ve built so far, regardless of where it’s going in the future. This new me I only got to know this year, and I’ve even started accepting the seemingly selfish thought that I had a part in achieving that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay and necessary to give yourself credit for something you’ve done, but to get to that point, you need to stop running every once in a while. &lt;strong&gt;Taking a moment and a step back to reflect and appreciate what you’ve already achieved can be a much more powerful and energizing experience than always looking for more things to improve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Hiring for "Culture Fit" Hurts Your Culture</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/6/11/why-hiring-for-culture-fit-hurts-your-culture.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/6/11/why-hiring-for-culture-fit-hurts-your-culture.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a term which in the sense of hiring (and firing), is more loaded than
anything else. I&amp;#39;m talking about the &lt;strong&gt;culture fit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://getlighthouse.com/blog/interview-mistakes/&quot;&gt;post on the Lighthouse
blog&lt;/a&gt; (a product I&amp;#39;m
actively using and that I&amp;#39;m a big fan of, by the way!) states that not checking
for culture fit is one of the eight interview mistakes that cost you great
  candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post brings up the most peculiar example in this regard, a company culture
of drinking (disclaimer: I&amp;#39;ve been a non-drinker for more than 16 years now).
If your company has a culture of heavy drinking, then you can be sure as hell
that someone like me will neither fit nor want to fit into that culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup culture in particular is known for their silent rituals and expectations
on new hires. If a mum or dad can&amp;#39;t go out to a bar at night, that&amp;#39;s a
thumbs-down, right? After all, they&amp;#39;re not willing to socialize, and your
company is like a family. A family that drinks together to create and maintain
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word culture fit continues to be thrown around both as reasons not to hire
someone and to fire someone. It&amp;#39;s a simple explanation, and it should be clear
to anyone on the team (and the person affected) why they&amp;#39;re not a culture fit,
right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one fundamental mistake in both using and looking for culture fit as a
means for hiring: &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re assuming that your current culture is healthy and
doesn&amp;#39;t need to be changed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using culture fit as a reason to fire or not to hire says more about you than it
says about them. It says that you&amp;#39;re not willing to dig deep and figure out what
exactly you think doesn&amp;#39;t match in your expectation and a candidates
personality. It shows that your culture is a fixed property of your company and
team, one that can&amp;#39;t be changed, one that is exactly where you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a reason to continue maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s take it one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a loaded word, because the word culture has so many possible
definitions. There are a lot of layers in your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s safe to assume that culture is represented by your company&amp;#39;s and team&amp;#39;s
values. If you&amp;#39;ve poured lots of work into those, then you have a good
definition of your team&amp;#39;s expected behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But culture goes beyond that. Culture is what happens at your company every day.
Culture includes founders buying themselves &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/technology/a-founder-of-secret-the-anonymous-social-app-shuts-it-down-as-use-declines.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;expensive
cars&lt;/a&gt;
from a secondary investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture includes silent expectations like going to socialization events in
evenings, like drinking at bars, dinners and other company events. No one wants
to put those on job ads, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture is how you write and phrase your job ads. Culture is whether you&amp;#39;re
looking for rock stars or want to build a great team and help people grow.
Culture is how you pay your people. Culture is how a CEO behaves towards their
team and in public. Culture is how leadership fosters and drives change. Culture
is how you treat your customers. Culture is how you treat your team. Culture is how
open you are to changing the status quo. Culture is a team that only consists of
white dudes in their late twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture is that ping pong table in your office. Culture are all those free and
unhealthy soft drinks that your company keeps in the fridge. Culture is serving
your team breakfast or lunch (or both?) every day to make sure they&amp;#39;re in the
office for as long as possible. Culture is talking about commitment issues when
someone on your team needs to leave early because they have children to take
care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you do every day, in your company and team, is part of your culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your assumption is that no one should be able to be a part of that and that
it&amp;#39;s written in stone and cannot be changes, then by all means, hire or fire
based on culture fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a means to keep people out of a protected and privileged circle,
rather than to protect that circle&amp;#39;s values, which is probably what you think it
is..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a means to avoid talking about whether your culture is healthy
and whether it needs to be improved, and most importantly, to avoid actively
changing and improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop using &amp;quot;culture fit&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If culture fit isn&amp;#39;t a reason for not hiring someone or firing someone, then
what is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a loaded word because it can have so many meanings, it can apply
on so many layers of your company. Using it means you want to spend little time
on figuring out where exactly someone isn&amp;#39;t a good match for your own
expectations and why those expectations exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid falling into the culture fit trap is to have an honest
look at why someone doesn&amp;#39;t match your expectations. Did they not match implicit
or explicit expectations? If they&amp;#39;re implicit, are they really a part of your
company culture? If they are, why are they not explicit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If socializing over drinks is an expectation you have, then you should be honest
enough to make it an explicit expectation. Or, if you want my advice, you should
revisit why and whether it&amp;#39;s such an important part of your culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I can tell you right here, making it explicit will help keep even more
people out of your precious circle. Parents, people of religion who don&amp;#39;t drink,
non-drinkers. You can be sure that those people will never be part of your
team, and that your team will continue to attract the same kind of people that
are already a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Culture fit&amp;quot; hampers the biggest benefit of any great team: diversity. Stop
using it and start looking at the real reasons why you don&amp;#39;t want to hire
someone. They might not be their flaws but yours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Alternate Reality for Startups</title>
      <link>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/5/19/an-alternate-reality-for-startups.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/5/19/an-alternate-reality-for-startups.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A reality where success isn&amp;#39;t measured in the amount of funding rounds or size
of acquisitions but in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/blog/100k&quot;&gt;monthly revenue and positive cash
flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where a startup&amp;#39;s impact isn&amp;#39;t measured with a hockey stick, but based
on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/3/27/building-an-ethical-business.html&quot;&gt;the impact it has on its community, its people and its
customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups acknowledge their own survivor bias and realize that
not everything they&amp;#39;ve done has lead them to where they are now, but that
they&amp;#39;re here in spite of what they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/6/17/a-short-story-on-human-error.html&quot;&gt;failure is neither celebrated nor
punished&lt;/a&gt;,
but always used as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/&quot;&gt;opportunity to learn and
improve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3045471/most-creative-people/rent-the-runways-formula-for-finding-and-fostering-women-leaders&quot;&gt;diversity is a requirement to build a great
company&lt;/a&gt;
rather than an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where co-founder isn&amp;#39;t a badge of honor, but where &lt;a href=&quot;https://keen.io//blog/117530017991/ask-why-a-lot-when-you-organize-your-startup&quot;&gt;everyone in the
company focuses on what they do now and in the
future&lt;/a&gt;,
regardless of their past achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where humility rather than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/rap-genius-co-founder-blasts-his-former-partners-2015-1&quot;&gt;big
ego&lt;/a&gt;
is a fundamental attribute of founders and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups &lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/2014/the-responsibility-to-give-back-our-charitable-giving-in-2014&quot;&gt;focus on the good they can
do&lt;/a&gt;
  rather than how fast they can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups are celebrated for how little money they needed to get
to where they are rather than how much money was invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups focus on work-life balance rather than try to keep
their people in the office and focused on work for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups focus on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home&quot;&gt;great work environment and supporting a
remote
culture&lt;/a&gt;
rather retaining their people by providing &lt;a href=&quot;https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us&quot;&gt;snacks, soft drinks, and other kinds
of perks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.bufferapp.com&quot;&gt;openness and transparency&lt;/a&gt; are the
default modus operandi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups don&amp;#39;t hire ninjas or rockstars or &amp;quot;the best,&amp;quot; but on
hiring great people and helping them grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where talking about money, cash flow,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/open&quot;&gt;revenue&lt;/a&gt;, profits, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://inside.idonethis.com/startup-expenses/&quot;&gt;costs of running a
startup&lt;/a&gt; is a source of
inspiration rather than seen as losing a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reality where startups acknowledge that there is no perfect reality, only
experimentation and continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these realities exist in isolation, and none of them necessarily needs
the other to co-exist. But imagine a world where a majority of them coincide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is any of these realities better? That&amp;#39;s up to you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these realities exist today, in one way or the other. They&amp;#39;re alternate
realities, they&amp;#39;re not dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
