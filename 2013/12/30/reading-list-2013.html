      <p>I got to read a lot of great books in 2013, shaping a lot of my current thinking
both in terms of business and web operations. If you&#39;re looking for something to
read, follow along!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k04aEv">Effective Monitoring and Alerting</a></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve developed an interest in improving our monitoring, and this book delivered
some good insight. The book is a quick read, and it ends up delivering a great
idea for how a monitoring system could be structured, without going too much
into implementation details.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a distinct lack of books on this topic, so this one is good to start
with.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/VIzk5F">The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — but Some Don&#39;t</a></strong></p>

<p>From the guy who predicted the 2012 election results, a great introduction on
statistics, probability, written in an entertaining style (i.e. not boring you
with too much math). Gives lots of examples from Nate&#39;s personal history of
getting into numbers and probabilities. Very entertaining read and will
definitely make you think about these topics some more.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/19CvJvW">The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable</a></strong></p>

<p>Nassim Taleb has an interesting writing style, to say the least. Among slews of
bashing other people and polishing his own ego, you&#39;ll find streaks of genius.</p>

<p>The Black Swan is a great read on managing risk, or the inability of managing
certain risks. If you&#39;re running any kind of application in production and are
actively involved in operations, this book is a must-read.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s point could be made in a significantly shorter version of it, but
that would of course deprive you from the joys of reading about Taleb&#39;s personal
feelings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1ggeyTC">The Art of Capacity Planning</a></strong></p>

<p>This book is a classic, and I only got around to reading it this year, shame on
me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s wonderfully short and to the point, dealing a lot with monitoring and
making your capacity planning work in the best ways possible.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read this book yet, start right now. It&#39;s timeless for anyone
working in web operations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/17MZDcz">Friendly Fire: The Accidental Shootdown of U.S. Black Hawks over Northern
Iraq</a></strong></p>

<p>A book describing in great detail the shootdown of two helicopters over the
no-fly zone in Iraq in the early nineties.</p>

<p>Why is this relevant and interesting? It&#39;s pretty terrible that people have died
during this incident.</p>

<p>The fascinating parts of this incident and the book are in what happened in all
the parties involved in the incidents and in the organizations as a whole, for
years leading up to the event.</p>

<p>This book was an eye-opener for me on how I think about production incidents. It
covers in great, great detail the events in a socio-technological organization, the
US military.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much to learn in this book that can be applied to web operations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/124nNwD">The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error</a></strong></p>

<p>Sidney Dekker is a great writer on topics are very relevant to web operations:
humans.</p>

<p>Human error is a common excuse for production incidents, all the more so when a
plane crashed or other bad things happen.</p>

<p>Dekker puts these things in perspective, and he&#39;s helped shape my thinking a
lot. What a human does in a particular situation, why he does it and how the
organization and the work environment have shaped his understanding of a
particular situation.</p>

<p>A great and highly recommended read, goes nicely with Snook&#39;s &quot;Friendly Fire.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1dkq4wR">Managing the Unexpected: Resilient Performance in an Age of Uncertainty</a></strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this book, I bought it on a hunch.</p>

<p>It turns out it&#39;s an important read when it comes to managing risk and achieving
organizational resilience. Fits in perfectly with the books mentioned just
before.</p>

<p>It looks at a slew of different industries and on how they handle risk and risky
situations. Fire departments, air travel, and lots more.</p>

<p>It introduces the concept of a high resilience organization and a lot of great
ideas, which are picked up by Dekker in a book introduced below.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k09Iic">Thinking in Systems</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The</strong> book on complex systems and systems theory.</p>

<p>I was amazed, only in hindsight, how important this book is. It introduces the
idea of complex systems and how parts in a complex system interact with each
other, how they influence each other, how even just small changes in one can
have long and delayed effects on others.</p>

<p>The book introduces these concepts in ways not directly related to web
operations and software, but you&#39;ll notice the relationships right away.</p>

<p>This is <strong>the</strong> book to read. Read this one first, read it now. The most
influential book I&#39;ve read in 2013.</p>

<p>After reading &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot;, you&#39;ll see systems and complex interactions
between systems everywhere. You know why? Because there are systems everywhere.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1d3lKOX">Small Giants: Companies That Chose to Be Great Instead of
Big</a></strong></p>

<p>Running a <a href="https://travis-ci.com">small little business myself</a>, I strive to get
as much inspiration and insight on how others running their companies as
possible.</p>

<p>This book has been a big inspiration for me. It covers a dozen or so companies
that did everything they could to build a balanced workplace with happy
employees and a long-lasting legacy rather than go for the big buck or for
outside funding.</p>

<p>Lots of great stories in this book. If you&#39;re running any kind of business, this
is a great read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1fEZykf">The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at
NASA </a></strong></p>

<p>This book is so chock full of insight on behaviors and interactions in
socio-technical organization, it kept blewing my mind over and over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the Challenger incident in 1986, and everything contributing to this
incident over years leading up to it.</p>

<p>The level of detail extracted by Diane Vaughan is amazing. She introduces the
term &quot;normalization of deviance&quot; in the book, a term that stuck with me, and
that I&#39;m now seeing everywhere. It provides a description for something that
naturally happens, whether we want it or not, but that seems unavoidable.</p>

<p>Again, this book isn&#39;t directly related to software, but it&#39;s so very relevant
to what we do in web operations. Humans, human interaction, organizations and
culture. I found these bits to be the most interesting and fascinating bits when
it comes to running anything in production.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious about these bits too, then this book is for you. Together with
&quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, it provides amazing insights and learnings for running your own
operations team or how to improve human interaction and culture at your company
overall.</p>

<p>These books are very relevant to the ideas of DevOps.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1k0cLaf">Drift Into Failure</a></strong></p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve read &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot;, &quot;Managing the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Friendly
Fire&quot;, and &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot;, here comes Dekker putting all of
them together, quite literally.</p>

<p>I was quite amazed to find references to all of them in this book.</p>

<p>The books left me wondering a bit on how you can detect normalization of
deviance, what you can learn from the Challenger and Iraq incidents, from
high-resilience organizations.</p>

<p>This book is Dekker helping you find answers.</p>

<p>Read &quot;Thinking in Systems&quot; first, then &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, &quot;Managing the
Unexpected&quot; and &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot;, and then read &quot;Drift Into
Failure&quot; to find more practical applications of what&#39;s been introduced in the
other books.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my mind blown several times by all of them. They&#39;re pretty amazing
eye-openers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1dktFuE">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></strong></p>

<p>Just started reading this, but it seems relevant to the topics of biases. Had it
on my reading list for a while now, so it&#39;s about time to read it.</p>

<p>Will have to report back on this soon.</p>
