      <p>A couple of months ago I set out to write a <a href="http://nosqlhandbook.com">book on
NoSQL</a>. It&#39;s about time I give an update on how it&#39;s
been going, and when you can expect a book in your hands, or rather, on your
screen.</p>

<p>After an initial burst of writing, I took somewhat of a break, so please excuse
the delay in general. I spent the last weeks writing (a lot), and I&#39;m currently
trying to polish and finish up the existing content so that I can throw
something out there for the world to peek at. Currently, the book covers
MongoDB, Riak and Redis in varying detail, and I&#39;m working to finish up loose
ends to get into a good shape, before I&#39;m starting work on more chapters.</p>

<p>A lot of people have asked me about pricing, distribution model, updates, and so
on, so I&#39;m following up with an FAQ section. In general, I&#39;m as keen to get
something out there as people have expressed their interest in reading it,
believe me.</p>

<p>Turns out though: writing a book is hard. It takes a lot of work, a lot of
discipline and creativity to come up with the right words and code examples. I&#39;m
not complaining, it&#39;s just something you don&#39;t realize from writing even
slightly longer blog posts. It&#39;s still an incredible learning experience too,
because I (and you) get to play with pretty much all of the features the
databases covered have to offer.</p>

<p>So bear with me, I&#39;m on it.</p>

<p>The book is not built around the idea that a big application is to be built with
each database. I&#39;m not a fan of that approach myself, as it makes it too easy to
lose track of details. It&#39;s full of small examples, focused on specific
features.</p>

<p><strong>How many pages does it have?</strong></p>

<p>As the book is still growing, and I&#39;m still playing with layouting details, I
can&#39;t give you an exact number, but the final book is probably going to have
more than 200 pages.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the pricing going to be?</strong></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t decided yet. It&#39;s not going to be in the single digits pricing range,
and as the book is pretty dense with content, I don&#39;t want to undercharge. I&#39;ll
keep you posted.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be early access to the book?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there will be. You&#39;ll be able to buy the beta of the book for a reduced
price, and follow the updates. Maybe even the commits on GitHub? I don&#39;t know.
Let <a href="mailto:meyer@paperplanes.de">me know</a> if that&#39;s something you&#39;re interested
in.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have some samples I can peek at?</strong></p>

<p>Not yet. Layout is still far from final, but I&#39;ll throw something out as soon as
an early access will be available.</p>

<p><strong>What databases are being covered?</strong></p>

<p>To reach my goal for a final release, I&#39;m covering Redis, MongoDB, CouchDB,
Riak, and Cassandra, all in varying detail. For some it makes more sense to go
deeper than for others.</p>

<p><strong>Are future updates included?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, as content gets added, typos get fixed, and new databases pop up, I&#39;ll send
updates to everyone buying the book. The updates are free. Consider buying the
book a subscription for more chapters on other databases.</p>

<p><strong>Are you extending the book with more databases over time?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I have an insatiable thirst to play with more databases, and I don&#39;t want
to deprive you of experiencing that too.</p>

<p><strong>Are you covering database SomeDB? I hear it&#39;s the next big thing!</strong></p>

<p>For now, the list of databases is fixed. What&#39;s coming after that, on the other
hand, is not. I&#39;m open to suggestions, but I&#39;d prefer some non-exotic over a
very domain-specific database you wrote for a recent project. I&#39;ll set up some
sort of voting when the final release is done.</p>

<p><strong>What formats will be available?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m currently working on PDF and ePub, with Kindle to follow. Gotta have my
priorities. A good-looking and readable PDF is my first priority, an ePub after
that. Buying the book includes access to all formats.</p>

<p><strong>Is there going to be a print edition?</strong></p>

<p>Print is not a priority right now.</p>

<p><strong>What are you using to write and generate the book?</strong></p>

<p>The book is written in Markdown (I hate LaTeX), converted to HTML using
<a href="https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a>, using
<a href="https://github.com/github/albino">Albino</a> for syntax-highlighting, and
converted to PDF using the awesome <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince XML</a>
library, I hope to eventually use <a href="http://docraptor.com/">DocRaptor</a> to create
the final result, as a Prince license is slightly out of budget, but DocRaptor
is pretty affordable.</p>

<p><strong>Where can I get updates on progress?</strong></p>

<p>Mostly be following <a href="http://twitter.com/roidrage">me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/nosqlhandbook">the handbook
itself</a> on Twitter.</p>
